[20:07:25] <red_sky> looks like I can be authed on the same account as another name on my accont, cool
[20:07:42] <Hogofwar> red_sky, does it work to upload?
[20:08:05] <red_sky> I'm checking
[20:08:14] <Hogofwar> You should change the readme to something else in the git as well
[20:08:21] <Hogofwar> Be a bit more informative
[20:08:27] <Hogofwar> :P
[20:08:38] <red_sky> yeah
[20:08:42] <red_sky> I just did a touch README
[20:09:12] <malik> Have you made it so people can't vote more than once?
[20:09:24] <Hogofwar> :/
[20:09:29] <Hogofwar> unfortunate lingering issue

[20:29:38] <anjoyed> logs look well on gh
[20:31:18] <red_sky> okay, I have one last thing to figure out with the irc logging
[20:31:22] <red_sky> and then it's basically all automated

[20:34:06] <tmoskowite> We have not picked a project yet
[20:34:58] <Homermon> dont think so
[20:35:23] <tmoskowite> i know
[20:35:23] <tmoskowite> that is I framed my sentence as a statement =)
[20:35:25] <Homermon> er right
[20:35:29] <Homermon> I has the dumb.
[20:35:31] <tmoskowite> no worries
[20:35:36] <Homermon> lol
[20:35:38] <tmoskowite> I read write wrong too as well
[20:38:32] <red_sky> okay, I think the bot is up and fully automated
[20:38:55] <red_sky> let's see if the bot times out now that I have closed my ssh connection
[20:39:29] <anjoyed> in a screen session?
[20:39:33] <anjoyed> or byobu
[20:39:40] <red_sky> I used screen
[20:41:42] <red_sky> IRC logs should be posted every 12 hours at 10am and 10pm server time
[20:41:45] <red_sky> I can adjust that as necessary
[20:42:05] <red_sky> once every hour might be more appropriate
[20:42:42] <anjoyed> 12 hours would prolly be fine
[20:43:02] <anjoyed> every hour then you would likely need to append to existing files
[20:47:38] <anjoyed> if I get time I'll do up some basic setup tuts tonight
[20:47:54] <red_sky> appending to existing files is fine
[20:48:04] <anjoyed> setting up projects, views, 2d graphics, opengl type stuff
[20:48:17] <red_sky> sounds good
[20:48:42] <red_sky> testing
[20:57:54] <Raionic> Where is the server located by the way?
[20:58:28] ### samboy has joined ##reddit-android-developers
