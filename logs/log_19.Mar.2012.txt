[20:08:05] <red_sky> I'm checking
[20:08:14] <Hogofwar> You should change the readme to something else in the git as well
[20:08:21] <Hogofwar> Be a bit more informative
[20:08:27] <Hogofwar> :P
[20:08:38] <red_sky> yeah
[20:08:42] <red_sky> I just did a touch README

[20:34:06] <tmoskowite> We have not picked a project yet
[20:34:58] <Homermon> dont think so
[20:35:23] <tmoskowite> i know
[20:35:23] <tmoskowite> that is I framed my sentence as a statement =)
[20:35:25] <Homermon> er right
[20:35:29] <Homermon> I has the dumb.
[20:35:31] <tmoskowite> no worries
[20:35:36] <Homermon> lol
[20:35:38] <tmoskowite> I read write wrong too as well
[20:38:32] <red_sky> okay, I think the bot is up and fully automated
[20:38:55] <red_sky> let's see if the bot times out now that I have closed my ssh connection
[20:39:29] <anjoyed> in a screen session?
[20:39:33] <anjoyed> or byobu
[20:39:40] <red_sky> I used screen
[20:41:42] <red_sky> IRC logs should be posted every 12 hours at 10am and 10pm server time
[20:41:45] <red_sky> I can adjust that as necessary
[20:42:05] <red_sky> once every hour might be more appropriate
[20:42:42] <anjoyed> 12 hours would prolly be fine
[20:43:02] <anjoyed> every hour then you would likely need to append to existing files
[20:47:38] <anjoyed> if I get time I'll do up some basic setup tuts tonight
[20:47:54] <red_sky> appending to existing files is fine
[20:48:04] <anjoyed> setting up projects, views, 2d graphics, opengl type stuff
[20:48:17] <red_sky> sounds good
[20:48:42] <red_sky> testing

[22:05:14] ### blaise_ has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[22:07:11] <anjoyed> neat. i guess since the bot didn't crash it just kept trying to reconnect

[22:07:53] <red_sky> yeah
[22:08:11] <red_sky> looks like Hogofwar did a good job there

[22:09:34] <mwrosen> hey
[22:09:37] <red_sky> hey
[22:09:50] <mwrosen> anything important happen since last night?
[22:10:28] <red_sky> well, Hogofwar made an IRC bot that just logs things
[22:10:29] <c0smic> mwrosen: Well, we have a website, Google+ circle, 475+ readers, etc.
[22:10:42] <red_sky> and I set it up on my VPS so it automatically puts it on the github
[22:10:49] <red_sky> we got permission from reddit to use reddit and the logo
[22:10:54] <c0smic> And as red_sky said, and sweet IRC logging bot.
[22:10:57] <joholz> http://www.reddit.com/r/RedditAndroidDev/comments/r45pt/reddit_have_approved_of_us_using_the_name_reddit/
[22:11:05] <red_sky> we have a Google+ circle, almost 500 subscribers
[22:11:15] <red_sky> and a new logo idea is pretty much golden
[22:11:21] <joholz> we got some more polls in the sidebar you should take a look at
[22:11:24] <red_sky> not really anything on the development front
[22:11:25] <mwrosen> does the irc bot actually post to github?
[22:11:41] ### Homermon has quit the server. (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[22:11:53] <anjoyed> oh ffs
[22:11:54] <joholz> yea, in increments
[22:12:01] <anjoyed> g+ profile suspended
[22:12:04] <red_sky> it stores logs locally
[22:12:09] ### ballpointcarrot has quit the server. (Quit: Quit.)
[22:12:25] <red_sky> I made a bash script that takes all the new and modified logs and commits them and pushes them
[22:12:39] <red_sky> and that bash script is run via cron 2 times a day at 7am and 7pm EST
[22:12:48] <mwrosen> ah ok
[22:12:50] <joholz> red_sky: oh, so your pushing to git

[22:13:23] <red_sky> https://github.com/RedditAndroidDev/IRC_Logs
[22:13:57] <joholz> think enough ppl know how to use git?
[22:14:10] <joholz> its pretty important for team coop
[22:14:35] <mwrosen> I belive ProGit is free
[22:14:40] <mwrosen> maybe that should be a sidebar link
[22:14:48] <joholz> yea thats what i was thinking
[22:14:54] <mwrosen> http://progit.org/book/
[22:15:01] <joholz> I passed over a cool link in /r/webdev: http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/other/easy-version-control-with-git/
[22:16:50] ### blaise_ has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[22:16:54] <mwrosen> so I didn't actually see a suggestion for a couple of the apps we talked about last night... life tracker, reddit app built from the ground up, etc.
[22:17:06] <red_sky> I suggested the reddit app
[22:17:09] <mwrosen> and i believe most of the suggestions right now are shitty games :P
[22:17:17] <red_sky> I figured vCarl would've put his down
[22:17:20] <joholz> i sugested a home launcher
[22:17:28] <mwrosen> oh, he did, my mistake
[22:17:42] <red_sky> I'm not doing a game, period
[22:18:04] <joholz> what if we gave you bajillions of moneyz?
[22:18:24] <red_sky> Then sure
[22:18:37] <mwrosen> i don't see your suggestion for a new reddit app, red_sky
[22:18:43] <red_sky> but there are too many places for it to not go anywhere and too many places for people to step on each other's toes
[22:18:49] <red_sky> it should be the second from the top, mwrosen
[22:18:51] <red_sky> or something like that
[22:18:55] <anjoyed> was thinking of posting some basic tuts on g+
[22:19:01] <anjoyed> is it worth the hassle?
[22:19:20] <anjoyed> 'Your profile will be reviewed again and re-enabled if it complies with the Google+ Names Policy. Reviews are usually completed within a few days.'
[22:19:26] <joholz> there area  ton of tuts out there already i would say
[22:19:48] <red_sky> ah, mwrosen, my reddit idea is submitted to the Idea Suggestions form
[22:19:56] <red_sky> I'm not sure how we can see what people have posted on there
[22:19:59] <joholz> yea, check sidebar
[22:20:01] <red_sky> unless someone has the link handy
[22:20:01] ### freetacos has quit the server. (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)

[22:21:09] <red_sky> They don't like your last name?
[22:21:42] <anjoyed> no, dont like it. Said to change it by 23rd or it would be suspended
[22:21:50] <red_sky> haha
[22:21:50] <anjoyed> guess they jumped the gun on that
[22:21:54] <red_sky> yeah
[22:22:02] <joholz> apps on list seem a lil lightweight
[22:22:36] <joholz> i do like some of the ideas though

[22:27:20] <ThatPlayer> ya for spring break =P
[22:27:26] <mwrosen> also what's with https://github.com/RedditAndroidDev/AlphaProject
[22:27:32] <homermonmoblie> Mmm....delicious.
[22:27:46] <joholz> my spring break just ended
[22:28:08] <homermonmoblie> What exactly is github?
[22:28:18] <joholz> http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/other/easy-version-control-with-git/

[22:29:16] <adamell> ^ this
[22:29:36] <c0smic> mwrosen: There is going to be an anouncement tomorrow on what apps and teams will be established.
[22:29:47] <homermonmoblie> I signed up after I registered on reddit, so now I'm not sure how to join the github group.
[22:29:47] <mwrosen> ok
[22:29:58] <mwrosen> thanks
[22:29:59] <homermonmoblie> Nice
[22:30:01] <c0smic> homermonmoblie: Have you filled out the form?
[22:30:27] <homermonmoblie> Yeah I already did that
[22:30:41] <homermonmoblie> I've been added on g+ etc.
[22:30:45] <c0smic> mwrosen: np, and the AlphaProject was just something we set up initially.  Nothing has been done to it.
[22:31:00] <c0smic> homermonmoblie: I'll see about adding you to the GitHub group
[22:31:35] <mwrosen> yeah haha. I'm also not part of the github/goole docs group and I filled out the form last night
[22:31:53] <homermonmoblie> Great! Thanks. The username should be able "Homermon"
[22:31:58] <c0smic> Dod both of you guys include the GitHub username I'm assuming?

[22:33:18] <mwrosen> ok done
[22:33:28] <homermonmoblie> Just got the email. Thanks!

[22:37:00] <homermonmoblie> As for the logo and name, should we still include reddit? Especially if we decide to charge for apps later on.

[22:38:07] <homermonmoblie> But in terms of profit for des
[22:38:15] <homermonmoblie> Devs*
[22:38:18] <c0smic> Well we'd only charge if there would be server costs
[22:38:32] <c0smic> and the rest of the profits would be donated to charity
[22:38:46] <c0smic> That way we don't have to deal with slptting it up between many devs
[22:38:50] <homermonmoblie> Hmm alright. Sounds good.
[22:41:08] <mwrosen> isn't donating all profits to charity a little altruistic for a bunch of programmer neckbeards?
[22:42:04] <mwrosen> i mean, it couldn't be /that/ hard for everyone to transparently see how much profit we're making
[22:42:33] <mwrosen> of course, I was under the impression that these apps would be free, but if we're planning on charging for the good ones, why not keep the $$
[22:42:47] <red_sky> keeping the money is iffy
[22:42:51] <adamell> Proceeds will go to ensure Kony gets elected next term
[22:42:52] <red_sky> 30% goes to google
[22:43:03] <red_sky> 25% goes to reddit if we use any of their stuff
[22:43:07] <c0smic> we'd only charge if the app requires a server
[22:43:15] <red_sky> so there's 55% divided among lots of people
[22:43:18] <homermonmoblie> My little Kony.
[22:43:29] <joholz> making it paid will def have more hassles
[22:44:04] <joholz> is there a g+ group that RAD has and i should be subbed to?
[22:44:09] <mwrosen> we don't have to use the reddit logo or name, so then we distriute 70% of the profit among the devs
[22:44:15] <mwrosen> dunno
[22:44:20] <mwrosen> I actually don't care
[22:44:22] <mwrosen> lol
[22:44:24] <homermonmoblie> I am heading off for now. Talk to you gents later.
[22:44:29] <mwrosen> bye
[22:44:29] <joholz> laters
[22:44:38] <red_sky> bye

[22:44:42] <c0smic> joholz: Yes there is, are you not in the RAD circle?
[22:44:50] <joholz> no, i dont think so
[22:44:54] <mwrosen> c0smic: i'm not in it either
[22:44:58] <mwrosen> mitchellwrosen@gmail
[22:45:08] <joholz> i am not very popular among folk
[22:45:27] <c0smic> mwrosen: I believe I added you not too long ago
[22:45:44] <mwrosen> to github ya
[22:45:53] <adamell> Google+ is like my uncle, perpetually drunk, alone, and alway hitting me when I talk too much.
[22:45:54] <c0smic> joholz: Can you PM your email or just post your url?
[22:45:58] <joholz> https://plus.google.com/116096116669335988657/posts?hl=en
[22:46:42] <c0smic> joholz: For me it says that you are in the Reddit Android Dev circle, I'll re-share it on my profile in a minute so everyone can add it
[22:47:10] <joholz> ok, thx
[22:47:42] <anjoyed> will g+ be used much?
[22:47:58] <adamell> No. It's Google Wave all over again.
[22:48:11] <adamell> Really fucking cool, but not widely adopted.
[22:48:13] <c0smic> anjoyed: I can see it being useful for staying in touch, and the Hnagout feature might be used eventually.
[22:48:29] <c0smic> Anyway, here is the RAD circle you guys should add: https://plus.google.com/110967715209297777321/posts/5AjqTpCvomM

[22:57:59] <c0smic> I think we'll leave it up for reference
[23:02:35] ### jaimeh has quit the server. (Ping timeout: 246 seconds)
[23:03:35] <blaise|> Where is the poll?
[23:03:52] ### jaimeh has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[23:06:59] <joholz> sidebar
[23:08:36] <blaise|> The only poll I see in the sidebar is for the name.
[23:09:02] <blaise|> If I click on app ideas it just takes me to the form to submit an idea.
[23:10:33] ### vcarl has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[23:11:44] <joholz> yea, thats what the poll is
[23:11:52] <joholz> some results: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AiVy8gDnGR-FdG8yMzUtcVhyWXVIS19nZ3NKYmVXNkE#gid=0
[23:12:01] <joholz> from app idea poll
[23:15:48] <anjoyed> some good ideas in there
[23:16:48] ### tuna83 has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[23:16:57] <nataly87s> tamagochi!
[23:16:59] ### Phorcys has quit the server. (Quit: Client Disconnect)
[23:17:50] <jaymax> nataly87s: That's my vote too
[23:18:03] <adamell> Konygochi!
[23:18:27] <nataly87s> i miss my old tamagochi :\
[23:18:47] <adamell> You steel everybody else's konys and teach them to kill with machetes
[23:18:54] <adamell> It'll make millions
[23:19:32] <danopia> does anyone have a translation file laying around from android? (just wondering)
[23:20:40] <anjoyed> tamagotchi would be good. the two way remote would be handy too
[23:21:32] <nataly87s> i already have a good remote app, but no tamagochi
[23:21:41] ### sam_ has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[23:21:44] <nataly87s> gmote - if you were wondering
[23:24:25] <blaise|> OK. So at some point will all the ideas be voted on?
[23:24:51] <sam_> not sure, prob soon though
[23:25:18] <blaise|> Or are we just going to pursue them all
[23:25:37] <blaise|> And each team member will decide what to work on?
[23:26:11] <c0smic> blaise|: we're going to be choosing tomorrow, and that's when we'll set the teams up as well
[23:26:29] <tuna83> Is there somewhere to donate code snippets, packages, or small projects that others can use as examples?
[23:27:18] <blaise|> C0smic: how is the decision on what apps and who will be working on them be made?
[23:27:32] <blaise|> Going to
[23:27:41] <jaymax> tuna83: you could push them to the git repo
[23:27:54] <tuna83> ok
[23:28:14] <c0smic> blaise|: We're going to be looking at what are most popular and what would be the best for what team's we'll get together
[23:28:33] <c0smic> Team size will also depend on the project, but they'll generally be small
[23:28:48] <jaimeh> I am in for development
[23:29:38] <vcarl> i feel like it should really just be decided by who wants to do things
[23:30:06] <vcarl> obviously with maximum sizes, we can't have 50 people make a tamagachi app very well
[23:30:43] <malik> I can't submit to the doc file...?
[23:30:51] <c0smic> Yes, we'll have another form set up so that people can input their skills, strengths and weakness, and they will sign up for what project they want to work on.
[23:33:08] ### jaimeh has quit the server. (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[23:33:25] <blaise|> So, how is the decision going to be made as to what ideas are most popular?
[23:33:38] <blaise|> Right now it is just a list of ideas?
