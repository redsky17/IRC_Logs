[20:07:25] <red_sky> looks like I can be authed on the same account as another name on my accont, cool
[20:07:42] <Hogofwar> red_sky, does it work to upload?
[20:08:05] <red_sky> I'm checking
[20:08:14] <Hogofwar> You should change the readme to something else in the git as well
[20:08:21] <Hogofwar> Be a bit more informative
[20:08:27] <Hogofwar> :P
[20:08:38] <red_sky> yeah
[20:08:42] <red_sky> I just did a touch README
[20:09:12] <malik> Have you made it so people can't vote more than once?
[20:09:24] <Hogofwar> :/

[20:12:58] <Homermon> Heading off for now, talk you you find people later.
[20:13:06] <Hogofwar> would it be allowed to post the source of the Log bot on the git?
[20:13:11] <Hogofwar> in it's own git repo
