[00:14:28] <red_sky> I'm setting up my other server
[00:14:37] <red_sky> so far everything's fantastic
[00:14:53] <red_sky> it's only $0.50 more than my current VPS
[00:15:00] <red_sky> so if it's good, I'll definitely make the switch
[00:22:00] ### RadLogii has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[00:22:01] <red_sky> well, right now, I'm hosting a rather important website on it
[00:22:04] <red_sky> technically for school
[00:22:07] <red_sky> but it's actually a business
[00:22:33] ### D__ has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[00:23:53] <red_sky> I'm not sure how long it will take to transfer everything over
[00:23:56] <red_sky> probably not too long.

[01:05:49] <blaise_> I also don't like how any of the reddit apps do the comment threads.
[01:06:11] <blaise_> There's a Touchpad app that has a very good comment implementation.  I was going to see about getting some screen shots of it.
[01:06:41] <blaise_> Or, I do like BaconReader's comment implementation on a phone.
[01:07:09] <anjoyed> haven't actually seen any of them
[01:07:18] <anjoyed> i usually just browse i.reddit
[01:08:46] <blaise_> It's been a long time since I've even logged into Slashdot.  I've been using it since it's early days, even have one of the lower membership numbers.  Should start checking it out.
[01:09:00] <blaise_> again.
[01:09:01] <anjoyed> if a lot of the projects need to use image storage/retrieval then might be wise to build an imgur component that they can add
[01:09:15] <anjoyed> rather than everyone implementing their own solution
[01:09:21] <blaise_> I was looking at the imgur api today
[01:09:26] <blaise_> Pretty straight forward.
[01:09:55] <blaise_> They do limit the number of calls per hour by IP (and if  you are anonymous or not).
