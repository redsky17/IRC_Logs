[00:14:28] <red_sky> I'm setting up my other server
[00:14:37] <red_sky> so far everything's fantastic
[00:14:53] <red_sky> it's only $0.50 more than my current VPS
[00:15:00] <red_sky> so if it's good, I'll definitely make the switch
[00:22:00] ### RadLogii has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[00:22:01] <red_sky> well, right now, I'm hosting a rather important website on it
[00:22:04] <red_sky> technically for school
[00:22:07] <red_sky> but it's actually a business
[00:22:33] ### D__ has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[00:23:53] <red_sky> I'm not sure how long it will take to transfer everything over
[00:23:56] <red_sky> probably not too long.

[01:05:49] <blaise_> I also don't like how any of the reddit apps do the comment threads.
[01:06:11] <blaise_> There's a Touchpad app that has a very good comment implementation.  I was going to see about getting some screen shots of it.
[01:06:41] <blaise_> Or, I do like BaconReader's comment implementation on a phone.
[01:07:09] <anjoyed> haven't actually seen any of them
[01:07:18] <anjoyed> i usually just browse i.reddit
[01:08:46] <blaise_> It's been a long time since I've even logged into Slashdot.  I've been using it since it's early days, even have one of the lower membership numbers.  Should start checking it out.
[01:09:00] <blaise_> again.
[01:09:01] <anjoyed> if a lot of the projects need to use image storage/retrieval then might be wise to build an imgur component that they can add
[01:09:15] <anjoyed> rather than everyone implementing their own solution
[01:09:21] <blaise_> I was looking at the imgur api today
[01:09:26] <blaise_> Pretty straight forward.
[01:09:55] <blaise_> They do limit the number of calls per hour by IP (and if  you are anonymous or not).
[01:10:03] <blaise_> But the limits are pretty high.
[01:10:29] <anjoyed> something to keep in mind though
[01:10:44] <blaise_> It seems like several of the apps could potentially use it, so I was thinking it might be a good framework to write
[01:11:12] <blaise_> And the caps are by IP…so, if each persons phone is doing it, that would only apply to that user.
[01:12:10] <anjoyed> 50 uploads per hour for anonymous
[01:12:21] ### markerz| has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[01:12:37] <blaise_> Yeah…and that's actually quite a bit of pictures.
[01:12:50] <blaise_> If the user logged in, it's higher too.
[01:12:58] <red_sky> 50 per hour is pretty high
[01:13:02] <red_sky> so that's not bad
[01:13:08] <anjoyed> yep. if you use oauth you get twice that per imgur account
[01:13:14] <red_sky> that's one picture per 1 and 1/10 minutes
[01:13:40] <blaise_> I was think that picture hunt game could potentially use imgur for hosting.
[01:13:57] <red_sky> or is it 1/5...
[01:14:03] <anjoyed> yeah, thats the one I had in mind
[01:14:03] <blaise_> Still would need some sort of server to do the voting, etc, but that's not the bandwidth hogging part
[01:14:22] <blaise_> Or disk storage

[01:19:41] <anjoyed> 500 credits per hour for anonymous use. every api call uses 1 credit, uploads use 10 credits
[01:20:02] <anjoyed> pretty decent
[01:20:14] <blaise_> Yeah….although you know I tried some calls today via my browser and it didn't count
[01:20:32] <blaise_> Not sure if they only count if you go against api.imgur.com or not
[01:20:54] <blaise_> but you can go to  www.imgur.com/gallery.json and it will give you the same thing
[01:21:19] <blaise_> You can also sub it and go to www.imgur.com/r/wtf.json or any of the reddit subs
[01:21:32] <anjoyed> i was thinking it would be handy to use one imgur account for an app and have all uploads go there
[01:21:33] <blaise_> That's the part I thought was cool.
[01:21:46] <anjoyed> but if many used the app you could well hit the credit limit
[01:21:51] <blaise_> Well, all pics are available for everybody.
[01:22:07] <blaise_> And if we wrote the framework to return the hash when you store it
[01:22:20] <blaise_> we could store that in a server side database and retrieve all the images
[01:22:33] <anjoyed> aye, would be handy
[01:22:58] <blaise_> That way each user could have either their oauth account or even anonymous if they uploaded less than 50 an hour.
[01:23:30] <blaise_> For retrieval, we could hit our server to get the hashes, and then have the client do the retrieve
[01:23:44] <blaise_> That way, again, it's against the client and not a bunch of hits from our server ip.

[01:34:00] <red_sky> apparently OpenJDK needs the preceding ./ whereas Sun JDK doesn't
[01:34:23] <red_sky> now the damn thing shouldn't time out all the time
[01:34:43] <anjoyed> good job
[01:35:19] <joholz> what were you working on?
[01:35:35] <red_sky> server migration
[01:36:07] <anjoyed> they moving south for the spring
[01:36:16] <red_sky> hopefully the new VPS won't have a shitty connection like my other one
