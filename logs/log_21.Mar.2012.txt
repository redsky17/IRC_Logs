[00:14:28] <red_sky> I'm setting up my other server
[00:14:37] <red_sky> so far everything's fantastic
[00:14:53] <red_sky> it's only $0.50 more than my current VPS
[00:15:00] <red_sky> so if it's good, I'll definitely make the switch
[00:22:00] ### RadLogii has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[00:22:01] <red_sky> well, right now, I'm hosting a rather important website on it
[00:22:04] <red_sky> technically for school
[00:22:07] <red_sky> but it's actually a business
[00:22:33] ### D__ has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[00:23:53] <red_sky> I'm not sure how long it will take to transfer everything over
[00:23:56] <red_sky> probably not too long.

[01:05:49] <blaise_> I also don't like how any of the reddit apps do the comment threads.
[01:06:11] <blaise_> There's a Touchpad app that has a very good comment implementation.  I was going to see about getting some screen shots of it.
[01:06:41] <blaise_> Or, I do like BaconReader's comment implementation on a phone.
[01:07:09] <anjoyed> haven't actually seen any of them
[01:07:18] <anjoyed> i usually just browse i.reddit
[01:08:46] <blaise_> It's been a long time since I've even logged into Slashdot.  I've been using it since it's early days, even have one of the lower membership numbers.  Should start checking it out.
[01:09:00] <blaise_> again.
[01:09:01] <anjoyed> if a lot of the projects need to use image storage/retrieval then might be wise to build an imgur component that they can add
[01:09:15] <anjoyed> rather than everyone implementing their own solution
[01:09:21] <blaise_> I was looking at the imgur api today
[01:09:26] <blaise_> Pretty straight forward.
[01:09:55] <blaise_> They do limit the number of calls per hour by IP (and if  you are anonymous or not).
[01:10:03] <blaise_> But the limits are pretty high.
[01:10:29] <anjoyed> something to keep in mind though
[01:10:44] <blaise_> It seems like several of the apps could potentially use it, so I was thinking it might be a good framework to write
[01:11:12] <blaise_> And the caps are by IP…so, if each persons phone is doing it, that would only apply to that user.
[01:12:10] <anjoyed> 50 uploads per hour for anonymous
[01:12:21] ### markerz| has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[01:12:37] <blaise_> Yeah…and that's actually quite a bit of pictures.
[01:12:50] <blaise_> If the user logged in, it's higher too.
[01:12:58] <red_sky> 50 per hour is pretty high
[01:13:02] <red_sky> so that's not bad
[01:13:08] <anjoyed> yep. if you use oauth you get twice that per imgur account
[01:13:14] <red_sky> that's one picture per 1 and 1/10 minutes
[01:13:40] <blaise_> I was think that picture hunt game could potentially use imgur for hosting.
[01:13:57] <red_sky> or is it 1/5...
[01:14:03] <anjoyed> yeah, thats the one I had in mind
[01:14:03] <blaise_> Still would need some sort of server to do the voting, etc, but that's not the bandwidth hogging part
[01:14:22] <blaise_> Or disk storage

[01:19:33] ### markerz- has quit the server. (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[01:19:41] <anjoyed> 500 credits per hour for anonymous use. every api call uses 1 credit, uploads use 10 credits
[01:20:02] <anjoyed> pretty decent
[01:20:14] <blaise_> Yeah….although you know I tried some calls today via my browser and it didn't count
[01:20:32] <blaise_> Not sure if they only count if you go against api.imgur.com or not
[01:20:54] <blaise_> but you can go to  www.imgur.com/gallery.json and it will give you the same thing
[01:21:19] <blaise_> You can also sub it and go to www.imgur.com/r/wtf.json or any of the reddit subs
[01:21:32] <anjoyed> i was thinking it would be handy to use one imgur account for an app and have all uploads go there
[01:21:33] <blaise_> That's the part I thought was cool.
[01:21:46] <anjoyed> but if many used the app you could well hit the credit limit
[01:21:51] <blaise_> Well, all pics are available for everybody.
[01:22:07] <blaise_> And if we wrote the framework to return the hash when you store it
[01:22:20] <blaise_> we could store that in a server side database and retrieve all the images
[01:22:33] <anjoyed> aye, would be handy
[01:22:58] <blaise_> That way each user could have either their oauth account or even anonymous if they uploaded less than 50 an hour.
[01:23:30] <blaise_> For retrieval, we could hit our server to get the hashes, and then have the client do the retrieve
[01:23:44] <blaise_> That way, again, it's against the client and not a bunch of hits from our server ip.

[01:34:00] <red_sky> apparently OpenJDK needs the preceding ./ whereas Sun JDK doesn't
[01:34:23] <red_sky> now the damn thing shouldn't time out all the time
[01:34:43] <anjoyed> good job
[01:35:19] <joholz> what were you working on?
[01:35:35] <red_sky> server migration
[01:36:07] <anjoyed> they moving south for the spring
[01:36:16] <red_sky> hopefully the new VPS won't have a shitty connection like my other one
[01:41:03] <joholz> what you think caused latency?
[01:44:17] <red_sky> my VPS
[01:44:21] <red_sky> or their service provider
[01:44:31] <red_sky> VPS provider* or service provider
[01:45:20] <red_sky> so I just realized that in the past 24 hours, I've only consumed some water, tea, a milkshake, 2 monster energy drinks, a clif bar, and some reese's pieces
[01:45:29] <red_sky> I need to find food.
[01:45:53] <joholz> haha wow, your going to be the end of yourself
[01:46:12] <red_sky> yeah, it's not intentional... I usually just get wrapped up in things and forget to eat
[01:46:42] <anjoyed> man, get some decent food into you
[01:46:55] <red_sky> all the "decent" food places are closed
[01:46:59] <red_sky> I'm out of food
[01:47:06] <red_sky> that leaves mcdonald's and taco bell
[01:47:26] <red_sky> both of which are disgusting
[01:47:27] <anjoyed> not good :<
[01:47:43] <joholz> quick stop at walmart
[01:48:00] <red_sky> hah, the nearest one is about 3 miles away
[01:48:02] <red_sky> I don't have a car
[01:48:17] <ThatPlayer> some grass
[01:48:21] <joholz> dirt
[01:48:29] <joholz> hunt
[01:48:40] <red_sky> lol
[01:48:55] <joholz> how do you live without a car?
[01:49:06] <joholz> bus?
[01:49:13] <red_sky> easy, 1) bike, 2) I'm a student
[01:49:13] <ThatPlayer> I live without a car, I'm a poor college student =)
[01:49:25] <red_sky> everything I usually do is within 2 miles
[01:49:37] <red_sky> though I don't like to go shopping with my bike as I lack panniers
[01:49:42] <ThatPlayer> I dorm so that's nice
[01:49:49] <ThatPlayer> But I'm getting a car next school year, commuting
[01:50:00] <joholz> also youd use a good amount of energy just to go ther i assume, 3 miles
[01:50:04] <red_sky> my shitty diet started ever since I got off my campus meal plan
[01:50:12] <red_sky> so I've gotten used to it
[01:50:16] <red_sky> it's been like a year, and was gradual
[01:50:37] <joholz> make a habit to put protein bars in your socks and pants
[01:50:46] <red_sky> haha
[01:51:15] <anjoyed> learn to cook. it's cheap, easy and tasty(ish)
[01:51:24] <red_sky> see, all of the good supermarkets are far away
[01:51:31] <red_sky> the ones in town are like twice the price
[01:51:50] <anjoyed> they don't have delivery?
[01:52:01] <red_sky> I've never heard of that, frankly
[01:52:09] <red_sky> except for that Amazon Fresh service or whatever
[01:52:29] <red_sky> okay,
[01:52:39] <red_sky> RadLogii is logging and syncing with Git
[01:52:43] <red_sky> so I did all that just fine
[01:52:51] <joholz> get a years supply of ramen
[01:53:03] <red_sky> everyone always suggests it
[01:53:07] <red_sky> it's what I basically lived on in the summer
[01:53:13] <red_sky> so I've grown to dislike it...
[01:53:16] <joholz> for the price its awesome
[01:53:19] <red_sky> yeah
[01:53:29] <red_sky> doesn't really have any nutritional value, though
[01:53:39] <joholz> have u tried other flavors?
[01:53:48] <joholz> yea i guess not, im not sure
[01:53:52] <red_sky> what do they make besides chicken, beef, and turkey?
[01:54:09] <joholz> well
[01:54:17] <joholz> you have 3 flavors there
[01:54:30] <red_sky> beef and turkey are inherently gross
[01:54:35] <joholz> if you mix them you can get up to 9 flavors
[01:54:37] <red_sky> chicken is the only one I liked
[01:54:42] <red_sky> I suppose that's true
[01:54:54] <red_sky> I'm going to try to find some food
[01:54:54] <aschneid> They have a shrimp flavor too, which I find quite disgusting
[01:54:55] <red_sky> I'll ttyl
[01:54:59] <joholz> thats a steady growth of 300%!
[01:55:01] <joholz> laters
[01:55:03] <joholz> take it easy
[01:55:20] <red_sky> you too.  I should be back in ~20
[01:55:22] <red_sky> minutes
[01:55:28] <joholz> ok
[01:55:45] <joholz> ill be waiting
[01:57:07] <joholz> im trying to get depeer into android dev, anyone have school reccomendations?
[01:57:52] <aschneid> If you  know Java, I'd say just read the developers guide, or check out some of the tutorial YouTube videos out there.
[01:58:03] <aschneid> Some of the links have been floating around here.
[01:58:30] <vcarl> hint for it: don't both with the syntax, learn the organization
[01:58:46] <vcarl> don't dive into the APIs and such, those are relatively easy, learn how apps are structure
[01:58:47] <vcarl> d
[01:59:17] <aschneid> Yeah, most of the books out there (and I believe the developer guide) initially start with intents, activities, etc
[01:59:28] <aschneid> Then delve into resources and how they are defined.
[01:59:40] ### Esge has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[01:59:46] <joholz> im thinking mainly about job, you think showing apps I make is enough?
[01:59:54] <aschneid> Yeah.
[01:59:56] <vcarl> for some
[02:00:08] <vcarl> depends where, of course
[02:00:18] <joholz> makes sense
[02:00:21] <aschneid> I don't think there are many schools that offer Android development officially.
[02:00:32] <vcarl> my community college offers a class
[02:00:35] <vcarl> but no degree or anything
[02:01:19] <aschneid> I mean, you have to get experience somewhere….and if you have a programming background and have put out a couple of apps (hopefully well received), most companies will take that to at least get the interview process going.
[02:01:54] <vcarl> yeah, having something in the market is huge
[02:01:54] <joholz> yea thats true
[02:02:09] <aschneid> I'm primarily a Java/JEE developer, but none of my applications have ever been internet facing.
[02:02:15] <vcarl> i have  a lot of little projects that are neat, but nothing that's actually in distribution
[02:02:19] <aschneid> So, I use the experience on my resume to get me in the door
[02:02:29] <aschneid> then ace the technical interview. :-)
[02:02:56] <joholz> how does one "ace the technical interview"?
[02:03:05] <vcarl> answer all their questions :P
[02:03:07] <anjoyed> know your shit
[02:03:11] <anjoyed> :)
[02:03:16] <aschneid> Depends on what they are asking.
[02:03:18] <joholz> haha nuff said
[02:03:28] <aschneid> I typically go in for Architect level positions now.
[02:03:43] <aschneid> So, the questions are different than a line level programmer
[02:04:18] <aschneid> But I would say, if we even get involved in the development here and *hopefully* get some apps out that you help work on
[02:04:26] <aschneid> That will be experience you can put on your resume
[02:04:46] <aschneid> Couple that with any individual learning you did (to ace the interview)
[02:04:55] <aschneid> That would get you in the door
[02:05:21] <aschneid> I've done hiring and interviewing in the past…I just want to see enough on your resume to make it sound like you know your stuff and have done the work
[02:05:41] <aschneid> I will weed out those who don't know what they are doing (or lying on their resume) in the interview
[02:05:44] ### Dillon[ca] has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[02:06:03] <joholz> well if they expect what I write on my resume i shoudln't have a problem
[02:07:08] <aschneid> Almost every interview I have been on (and that's probably about 30-40 in the last 15 years…) always covers what you have on your resume
[02:07:26] <aschneid> Then they will almost always go beyond your comfort zone to see where your limits are
[02:09:12] <aschneid> The problem is finding a company that will pay you to do Android development. :-)
[02:09:13] ### alextsc has joined ##reddit-android-developers

[02:10:05] <anjoyed> guten morgen
[02:10:09] <aschneid> Yeah…I've been working for a little over 15 years.  Mostly consulting/contracting work

[02:13:32] <joholz> red_sky is back?
[02:13:35] <red_sky> joholz the most important part of learning Android development is the organizational flow of the app.  It's radically different than anything I've done on PC in the bast
[02:13:35] <vcarl> i'm MI
[02:13:37] <red_sky> past*
[02:14:15] ### RAWR has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[02:14:45] <joholz> red_sky: are you talking about app states and how the stack is influenced?
[02:15:10] <aschneid> I think he's talking about how events get triggered etc.
[02:15:12] <red_sky> I'm talking about things like Intents, Views, etc.
[02:15:23] <red_sky> Activities
[02:15:36] <red_sky> the stuff that's really integral to Android development
[02:15:36] <joholz> services, etc. got it
[02:15:39] <red_sky> it's not hard to figure it out
[02:15:41] <aschneid> It's actually similar to how some of the newer GUI environments work.
[02:15:49] <red_sky> but if you dive in without understanding, you'll make a shitty app
[02:15:52] <aschneid> C# has WPF that's actually similar
[02:15:58] <red_sky> WPF is fun
[02:16:05] <red_sky> though nothing for intents or activities
[02:16:09] <red_sky> those are really different
[02:16:43] <joholz> oh yea, ive played with mono for android
[02:17:05] <vcarl> anyone ever fiddle with Qt?
[02:17:07] <aschneid> Well…depends on how you look at it.
[02:17:18] <vcarl> I love the way it's organized, it fits my brain
[02:17:19] <red_sky> i have vcarl
[02:17:28] <red_sky> very briefly
[02:17:34] <aschneid> When I was first looking at it, it definitely reminded me of my WPF days.
[02:17:54] <red_sky> I used Qt to host the window I made for an OpenCV project I made
[02:17:57] <vcarl> signals and slots! it's all interrupts :)
[02:18:10] <aschneid> It also reminds me of some of the web toolkits out there.

[02:31:02] <red_sky> my house doesn't have internet... so
[02:31:07] <red_sky> my apartment, however, does
[02:31:43] <joholz> geez, those are blazing speeds
[02:31:45] <danopia> this is insane
[02:31:55] <danopia> as soon as i start the test, it starts at like 90Mb
[02:31:57] <red_sky> I love how America has like the 50th slowest internet in the world
[02:32:05] <red_sky> and we invented it, basically
[02:32:09] <danopia> then it jumps to 400-500Mb/s and completes the test instantly

[02:33:44] ### vcarl has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[02:34:08] <vcarl> to be fair, south korea has like 8 people
[02:34:15] <joholz> red_sky its simple, the more were limited, the more they can charge
[02:34:27] <vcarl> our infrastructure also sucks
[02:34:58] <vcarl> we need a repeat of the 60s highway construction, but with network cables
[02:35:03] <danopia> first to market == older infra
[02:35:05] <red_sky> south korea has a higher population than Canada
[02:35:09] <red_sky> 48,875,000 or so
[02:35:19] <red_sky> and our infrastructure is almost entirely fiber
[02:35:25] <red_sky> so I highly doubt that's it
[02:35:35] <joholz> greed i tell you
[02:35:45] <danopia> the good part of it, yes
[02:35:49] <vcarl> is it almost entirely fiber?
[02:35:58] <danopia> not the part to consumers, except FiOS
[02:36:07] <red_sky> all of the backbone is 100% fiber
[02:36:08] <vcarl> yeah, that's what i thought
[02:36:16] <red_sky> and then fiber connects all the substations, or whatever
[02:36:20] <vcarl> the distribution cables are still limited though
[02:36:20] <danopia> our ADSL line is lowquality
[02:36:23] <red_sky> and then from there it's cable
[02:36:25] <danopia> it gets bad signal
[02:36:42] <red_sky> I've had that issue in the past.  It's like a satellite dish... randomly goes off and on
[02:36:45] <danopia> sometimes the modem negotiates a speed that equates to about 3 KBytes/second
[02:36:50] ### Airheebz has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[02:36:58] <danopia> because it negotations while the line has noise
[02:37:08] <danopia> (no exagoration, either)
[02:37:21] <vcarl> a fair amount of prices are because of regional monopolies, but some of it is shitty infrastructure
[02:37:36] <danopia> well yea, also monopoly of multiple companies
[02:37:40] <danopia> like mobile phone service
[02:37:47] <danopia> i forget the fancy name
[02:37:54] <danopia> multipoly?
[02:37:54] <red_sky> geographic monopolies are the worst
[02:37:55] <danopia> w/e
[02:37:59] <vcarl> oligopoly
[02:38:06] <red_sky> yeah, vcarl got it
[02:38:08] <vcarl> just took business last semester :P
[02:38:17] <red_sky> there's also probably certainly some collusion going on
[02:38:26] <red_sky> even though that's illegal, it's hard to prove.
[02:38:43] <vcarl> mhm
[02:38:58] <red_sky> romania has faster internet than the US, wtf.
[02:39:15] <vcarl> comcast "limits" my internet to 250gb/month, a soft cap
[02:39:22] <red_sky> yeah
[02:39:25] <red_sky> that's a new thing
[02:39:31] <red_sky> I hate it
[02:39:32] <vcarl> that's great for a single person, or 2-4, but with  we go 100gb over every month
[02:39:38] <vcarl> they haven't done anything yet though
[02:39:39] <red_sky> yeah, exactly
[02:39:41] <vcarl> *with 7
[02:39:49] <red_sky> if you go over it like... 3 months in a row, you'll get an email
[02:39:59] <red_sky> telling you they'll terminate your service if it continues
[02:40:01] <vcarl> heh, we're at 6, i've checked :P
[02:40:57] <red_sky> I'm surprised they haven't done anything yet
[02:41:01] <TheNumb> Hello (:
[02:41:04] <vcarl> me too
[02:41:06] <vcarl> hellooo
[02:41:12] <alextsc> hey
[02:41:19] <Airheebz> i got one of those letters after i downladed about 800Gb of data one month
[02:41:20] <vcarl> i have a friend who used 1.2tb in a month, then 500, then 700
[02:41:21] <TheNumb> Do we have a splash image for our apps?
[02:41:36] <vcarl> he got a personal phone call
[02:41:52] <TheNumb> vcarl: 1.2 TB?!
[02:41:57] <vcarl> yes.
[02:42:02] <red_sky> that's a large amountt
[02:42:03] <vcarl> constantly torrenting EVERYTHING
[02:42:07] <Airheebz> i just got a letter that said if i use over 200Gb again they will terminate account
[02:42:11] <red_sky> if it was all legal, that's very impressive
[02:42:11] <vcarl> he has like 12tb filled on his HTPC
[02:42:28] <vcarl> Airheebz, that sucks
[02:42:41] <red_sky> I got warned for torrenting
[02:42:42] <red_sky> like 3 times
[02:42:44] <Airheebz> meh, just have to watch what i download
[02:42:44] <vcarl> TheNumb, i don't know, but we have that logo vote that's wrapping up soon
[02:42:46] <red_sky> because my roommates liked to torrent
[02:42:53] <TheNumb> vcarl: I know, I know :P
[02:43:08] <Airheebz> sucks during steam sales :D
[02:43:12] <vcarl> hahaha
[02:43:40] <red_sky> penn state dorm users have a limit of 10GB // week
[02:43:44] <red_sky> I went over it all the time
[02:43:57] <red_sky> after you go over, they reduce speeds to 56k for the rest of the week
[02:44:04] <vcarl> ewww
[02:44:06] <TheNumb> red_sky: ummm, that sucks.
[02:44:08] <red_sky> and multiple infractions result in losing internet in your dorm
[02:44:13] <red_sky> it was super fast internet, too
[02:44:16] <vcarl> at mich tech, i got a DMCA violation once
[02:44:18] <TheNumb> red_sky: well, that's what my mobile carrier does.
[02:44:20] <red_sky> apparently it was 3GB / week like 3 years ago
[02:44:22] <TheNumb> >.>
[02:44:25] <vcarl> had to pay $100 and take a copyright law test
[02:44:32] <red_sky> wow, that sucks
[02:44:46] <red_sky> a student got escorted out of class here a few years back by federal agents
[02:44:48] <vcarl> for a bad copy of the movie that was in russian too, totally not worth it
[02:44:50] <red_sky> for piracy
[02:44:50] <vcarl> O_o
[02:45:41] <TheNumb> >.>
[02:46:03] <TheNumb> Apparently nobody gives a shit about piracy in Poland ;D
[02:46:35] <vcarl> lucky bastard :P
[02:46:50] <TheNumb> There are lots of people torrenting in student houses :P
[02:47:11] <TheNumb> No data cap, 1 Gbps speed :D
[02:49:10] <red_sky> oooo, that's nice
[02:49:11] <red_sky> new VPS
[02:49:18] <red_sky> running nginx and a java program
[02:49:29] <red_sky> 1.2GB free RAM (out of 2GB), and like 98% idle CPU
[02:49:50] <vcarl> nice
[02:49:58] <vcarl> i sort of understand what that means
[02:50:05] <TheNumb> red_sky: Unused RAM if wasted RAM :D
[02:50:10] <TheNumb> is*
[02:50:16] <red_sky> yeah, well it's better than my other vps
[02:50:23] <red_sky> where 90% of 512MB was in use
[02:50:27] <red_sky> and there wasn't much going on
[02:57:15] <anjoyed> RadLogii will be happy
[02:57:16] <red_sky> well, night all
[02:57:21] <anjoyed> nn
[02:57:43] <vcarl> 'night

[03:44:01] <Hogofwar> hey member68
[03:44:51] <member68> morning :)
[03:45:08] <ThatPlayer> Morning
[03:46:43] <member68> anything happen in the last 8 hours? btw, we need a better system tracking decisions and progress
[03:46:50] <member68> *system for tracking
[03:47:51] <joholz> no nothing much, just new polls
[03:47:51] <TheNumb> member68: HAI
[03:48:05] <aschneid> I had a conversation about potentially writing an imgur framework (and maybe an app) after looking through some of the potential app idea.
[03:48:14] <aschneid> (when my nick was blaise_)
[03:48:19] <Hogofwar> !logs
[03:48:34] <TheNumb> aschneid: we could use imgur API.
[03:48:53] <TheNumb> It's fairly simple.
[03:48:54] <aschneid> However, I'm not sure the chat log picked everything up because the bot was up and down
[03:49:01] <aschneid> Yeah….that was part of the discussion
[03:49:34] <Hogofwar> aschneid, it was?
[03:49:39] <aschneid> I have the log saved here locally
[03:49:53] <member68> good idea, especially since it's related to Reddit.
[03:49:56] <aschneid> Hogofwar: the imgur api was discussed
[03:50:11] <joholz> the bot should be good now, I think i remember him saying he did some work
[03:50:12] <Hogofwar> aschneid, I mean the bot going up and down
[03:50:24] <member68> care to send me the log? i'll read it for breakfast
[03:50:28] <aschneid> Yeah….I tied it into discussion of the Reddit apps and the picture hunt apps (have an idea for it.
[03:50:41] <danopia> member68, log of this chan?
[03:50:45] <danopia> i've been logging since i joined
[03:50:52] <aschneid> Hogofwar: It was a problem with red_sky's vps
[03:50:57] <Hogofwar> K
[03:51:09] <aschneid> He switched and it's been up since
[03:51:27] <aschneid> Of course, it was bouncing up and down while we were talking about the imgur framework. :-)
[03:51:47] <danopia> i can scp my log up to the cluster but it's very extensive
[03:51:50] <aschneid> member68: you want it here, or somewhere else?
[03:51:53] <anjoyed> think most of it was logged
[03:52:12] <member68> don't care. whatever works
[03:52:20] <danopia> http://cs.drexel.edu/~djl75/FreeNode-%23%23reddit-android-developers.log
[03:52:26] <danopia> is everything
[03:52:48] <danopia> in case anyone wants it...
[03:52:50] <member68> danopia: what timezone is that?
[03:52:56] <danopia> EST
[03:53:03] <danopia> i have no idea when it was first started
[03:53:19] <danopia> but it's 443KB of IRC
[03:54:03] <member68> you're up at 4AM? not bad
[03:54:06] <danopia> i lied
[03:54:15] <danopia> that excludes the entire time i'm on linux
[03:54:18] <danopia> windows*
[03:54:21] ### vcarl has quit the server. (Ping timeout: 246 seconds)
[03:54:24] <danopia> which was 15 horus
[03:54:30] <aschneid> The conversation starts at 00:58:48 in danopia's log
[03:54:51] <danopia> thank you for ctrl-f-friendly
[03:55:50] <aschneid> Goes to 01:25:39
[03:55:54] <danopia> i'm going to set up a loop to scp the latest log up every 30 minutes
[03:56:13] <aschneid> Basically between anjoyed and myself (blaise_ at the time)
[03:56:18] <danopia> done, i ahve to sleep now
[03:57:45] <danopia> heck, i could mount the cluster's nfs locally and tell xchat to log line-by-line into that....
[03:57:49] <danopia> but too mcuh effort :P
[03:58:06] ### Fault has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[03:58:49] <aschneid> I'm using Colloquy on a Mac and just realized all the logs are in XML…makes it a pain to send to anybody.  Glad you had your logs available danopia.
[03:58:54] <member68> go to bed, danopia. you deserve it
[03:59:21] <danopia> member68, but i didn't do any work on RAD today :(
[03:59:28] <danopia> i did get an IRL job of sorts though
[03:59:36] <danopia> work study position, programmin'
[04:00:23] <aschneid> Speaking of IRL job, I need to be up in the morning myself and it's 1:00 am here on the west coast, so I'm heading out myself
[04:00:40] <member68> alright. see you later
[04:00:51] <danopia> it's basically an app for a NFC tablet (might be custom, but probably not once the hardware gets there) that one would use to organize their clothes and find matching outfits and such... "Smart Closet"
[04:01:16] <danopia> the entire team except one and another dev are girls, and the first interview question awas "are you comfortable with dealing iwth women's clothing" :P
[04:01:21] <danopia> except me and*
[04:01:44] <aschneid> What would you need the NFC for?  The clothes will be tagged?
[04:01:51] <danopia> yes
[04:01:52] <alextsc> meh we should really move more of the relevant discussions to the mailing list, those IRC logs are terrible to read QQ
[04:02:17] <danopia> well, the hangers, i assume. not filled in on all the details yet
[04:02:32] <danopia> bye
[04:02:40] <aschneid> later
[04:02:48] <alextsc> cya
[04:03:09] <aschneid> alextsc…I would be more than happy (in the morning) to post something on google groups with a summary of the chat logs
[04:03:15] <aschneid> Just wasn't sure if it was worth it.
[04:03:30] <aschneid> Especially considering we have decided on the apps yet...
[04:03:35] <Hogofwar> danopia, why couldn't you say: the entire team are girls except two
[04:03:45] <aschneid> All the ones I voted for though probably could use an imgur framework.
[04:03:47] <alextsc> yeah that decision has to come soon
[04:04:02] <alextsc> there seems to be some interest in certain apps
[04:04:03] <aschneid> Anyway, I'm out….talk to you later this morning.
[04:04:14] <alextsc> alright, cya :)
[04:04:25] ### aschneid is now known as aschneid|away
[04:06:09] ### deliwien has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[04:07:44] <member68> it's interesting to read the "what do you want to work on"-poll resultse
[04:08:01] <ThatPlayer> Are you going to share? =P
[04:08:14] <member68> many people suggest getting to work quickly and sort out organizational stuff later
[04:08:56] <ThatPlayer> It'll keep people interested I'd think
[04:08:57] <alextsc> =)
[04:09:16] <alextsc> well i think we got decent organization for now
[04:09:21] <alextsc> we should really get started asap
[04:09:27] <alextsc> before things fall apart
[04:09:38] <alextsc> if we build one or two throwaway project, hey who cares?
[04:09:50] <alextsc> but we will learn from that
[04:10:33] <member68> also, we got about 50 devs, of which 10 know something about UI design. only one person who wants to be PM though
[04:10:45] <Fault> member68: How many have signed up for being lead dev/PM atm?
[04:10:52] <Fault> oh
[04:10:55] <Fault> nvm
[04:11:25] <alextsc> i stated it in the comment section; I think the lead will get determined when we got teams set
[04:11:32] ### Fault is now known as RAWR
[04:11:51] <alextsc> "i want to lead project X" when its not even decided that this is going to get built is kinda pointless
[04:12:00] <RAWR> True
[04:12:01] ### aschneid has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[04:12:01] <alextsc> (imho)
[04:12:30] <joholz> ok guys
[04:12:33] ### Hogofwar has quit the server. (Ping timeout: 246 seconds)
[04:12:33] <joholz> nite
[04:12:44] <alextsc> good night :)
[04:12:54] ### joholz has quit the server. (Quit: Page closed)
[04:13:52] <alextsc> brb shower, the nerd smell is taking over :>
[04:14:18] <member68> alextsc, we're posing the question differently. we ask "do you want to lead a project, if yes, which one?"
[04:14:24] ### matt-ice has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[04:15:14] <matt-ice> sup
[04:16:27] <member68> i'm starting to get the feeling though, that we should just start and find out that way of organization works. i think we'll have a few people who are assigned to multiple projects to set the general direction of development. besides that, teams would more or less on their own.
[04:16:38] <member68> any opinions on that?
[04:17:00] <ThatPlayer> Sounds great
[04:17:15] <matt-ice> interesting... I agree
[04:17:44] <member68> sound chaotic to me right now, but I guess as a community, there is no right or wrong way
[04:20:16] <member68> i was just going over the table again. only one person put down management, however about 10 people added projects they want to lead
[04:20:38] <TheNumb> member68: since we have people all around the globe some portion of work could be done say by the guys in the US and then it'd be taken over by the guys from EU to keep the things rolling ;-)
[04:20:48] ### anyonethinkingab has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[04:21:08] <TheNumb> I mean, taken over by the end of the day in the US :P
[04:21:16] <TheNumb> If you know what I mean.
[04:21:29] <TheNumb> That's what big players do ^^
[04:21:35] <matt-ice> TheNumb: once this goes in full swing it will be the fastest dev team in the world :) 24/7 coding
[04:21:43] <TheNumb> matt-ice: yeah.
[04:22:20] <TheNumb> ^^
[04:22:40] <member68> we have the advantage that we are a small team. it's easier to coordinate.
[04:23:02] <member68> but getting everybody to an acceptable level of coding experience is a big task
[04:23:10] <member68> but we'll get there
[04:23:18] <deliwien> yeah, the timezone is something we have to think about when choosing the team members
[04:23:29] <TheNumb> member68: we'll have to get there ;p
[04:23:53] <matt-ice> member68: TheNumb for this the educational app would be great
[04:24:11] <matt-ice> get the best to work on that and then education can begin for the rest of us
[04:24:40] <TheNumb> Well, I think I could join guys from Germany as we are in the same timezone.
[04:29:24] <member68> when you say educational app, do you mean a "how to write for android" app?
[04:30:41] <matt-ice> member68: that, also java tutorials, text/video based, I dont have an exact idea for that, Im refering to what was posted on /r/
[04:31:28] <member68> the app itself is easy to write. but we would we get the content?
[04:31:37] <TheNumb> member68: redditors :D
[04:31:55] <TheNumb> We could also spam a little on /r/java and /r/androiddev
[04:33:55] ### markerz has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[04:35:39] <alextsc> and back :)
[04:36:22] <alextsc> member68, yes, I know that the question was worded that way. The "project to lead" decision is one point.
[04:36:31] <TheNumb> alextsc: and welcome back ;D
[04:36:35] <alextsc> thanks :)
[04:37:07] <alextsc> i thought about PM for myself, but I decided that there are not enough infos yet for me
[04:37:24] <alextsc> i dont have any open source experience at all, let alone leading a project
[04:37:41] <alextsc> i mean, i can dive into that, if i write code or emails for 2 hours a day doesnt matter
[04:37:51] <alextsc> as long as i have the feeling to help and contribute
[04:38:16] <member68> i don't have much experience either. but i'm motivated and i have some time i can spend on it.
[04:38:20] <alextsc> but the project should be at least interesting for myself
[04:38:29] <alextsc> and i want to know the team beforehand
[04:38:43] <alextsc> 15 chaotic redditors are more of a challenge than 8 dedicated people
[04:38:45] <member68> btw, everybody, a reddit client seams to get the most interest from people willing to lead teams
[04:38:48] <alextsc> (if that makes sense)
[04:39:06] <member68> true, alextsc
[04:39:08] <alextsc> i dont want to start on hard-mode basically :)
[04:39:45] <TheNumb> So, how many designers do we have?
[04:39:53] <member68> it's hard to judge people you have never worked with before. that's what the initial projects are for. getting people up to speed, and to find out who actually is ready to do some work
[04:40:03] <member68> thenumb, let me check
[04:40:34] <member68> by desigerns, you mean interface and graphics?
[04:40:36] <alextsc> right
[04:40:39] <TheNumb> member68: yes
[04:41:15] <member68> 15 designers
[04:41:26] <TheNumb> Wow
[04:41:28] <TheNumb> That's nice
[04:41:42] <alextsc> indeed :o
[04:41:52] <member68> some of them are UI only though.
[04:41:58] ### zubsani has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[04:42:09] <member68> but we got a nice group here
[04:42:32] <TheNumb> We'll also need people with experience in backend/api development :<
[04:43:00] <alextsc> I think we got some from what I've seen
[04:46:29] <anyonethinkingab> member68 we have a good amount of possible PM's
[04:47:14] <matt-ice> do you think that a reddit client would be a good idea? I know there are many and there is always room for one more... but unless this would bring something truly new, we would be just making a copy of f5, reddit is fun, reddionic, baconreader etc tec
[04:47:48] <TheNumb> matt-ice: it would be great.
[04:47:58] <TheNumb> matt-ice: Reddit client from redditors.
[04:48:06] <member68> do any of you know how i have to set up github to allow the following workflow: somebody wants to change code -> new branch -> code must be approved by a experienced dev(could be part of a guthub team). i think currently everybody can push code without any review process
[04:48:10] <matt-ice> TheNumb: arent all of them from redditors?
[04:49:53] <TheNumb> matt-ice: dunno ;D
[04:50:37] <matt-ice> TheNumb: ok, lets brainstorm here, what could we have the client do that hasnt been done?
[04:50:54] <TheNumb> Ummm...
[04:51:03] <TheNumb> Less cluttered ui :D
[04:51:36] <TheNumb> Image gallery when browsing subreddits like /r/pics /r/funny
[04:51:57] <wjoe> Morning all
[04:51:57] <anyonethinkingab> a bit more like 9gag, but then on a phone/tablet
[04:51:58] <markerz> You dont necessarily have bring something new to the table.  It can be as simple as redesigning the UI.
[04:52:00] <TheNumb> wjoe: oahi
[04:52:01] <anyonethinkingab> morning
[04:52:16] <TheNumb> anyonethinkingab: haaaaai
[04:52:21] <anyonethinkingab> lol
[04:52:44] <TheNumb> :D
[04:52:47] <zubsani> hi guys
[04:52:50] <matt-ice> the best UI I had was reddionic
[04:53:01] <wjoe> Sounds like there's been progress overnight?
[04:53:03] <matt-ice> no flashy animations, just speedy reddit
[04:53:09] <zubsani> open this site on your phone/tablet http://rheza.github.com/9pics/
[04:53:24] <zubsani> we don't need another app for replicate the 9gag experience

[04:56:11] <anyonethinkingab> yup
[04:56:13] <anyonethinkingab> i made it
[04:56:14] <member68> anyonethinkingab, leave the http and www?
[04:56:30] <anyonethinkingab> member68 in the channel description
[04:56:34] <zubsani> why ?
[04:56:45] <anyonethinkingab> to vote on a project we will make
[04:57:04] <anyonethinkingab> have you looked at it?
[04:57:15] <matt-ice> polls polls polls!!! where is our poll voting app? it could be the greatest circlejerk of all time!
[04:57:20] <zubsani> i already fill in exactly same form like 6 hours ago
[04:58:22] <anyonethinkingab> it was updated once, but it should be the same one indeed if it was only 6 ours ago
[04:58:53] <anyonethinkingab> yeah zub you already filled that poll in :D

[05:06:10] ### zubsani has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[05:06:45] <member68> i'm reading up on what pull requests are. haven't quite figuered that out
[05:07:41] <alextsc> yeah, i don't have much experience myself with git(hub), apparently you need pull requests to do any codereview
[05:08:29] <alextsc> if you need somebody to test the workflow throgh, hit me up
[05:08:35] <alextsc> through that is
[05:10:56] <member68> looks like i have to fork the project, create a new branch in the fork, commit changes to the branch, and then i can create a pull request to have it added back to the main project

[05:11:25] ### zubsani has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[05:13:48] <alextsc> mhm does it make sense to branch in this case; opposed to the fork + pull-request only?
[05:14:08] <alextsc> i really have to read up on git a bit :D
[05:15:01] ### RAWR has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[05:17:24] <RAWR> Ughh why does the website have overflow:hidden? Can't see the whole thing on my netbook D:

[05:18:28] ### markerz has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[05:21:04] <RAWR> Oh... because of the gradient I see. :/
[05:22:58] <zubsani> i will try to create new website as soon as possible
[05:25:29] <member68> if you send me code to add another gradient at the bottom, i'll add it and make it scrollable
[05:27:42] <zubsani> so, you only want me to add another gradient at the bottom, and make it scrollable ?
[05:27:53] <member68> pretty much
[05:27:56] <zubsani> i planing to create something with bootstrap
[05:28:03] <zubsani> planning*
[05:28:09] <zubsani> http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/examples/hero.html
[05:28:31] <zubsani> ok, i will see what i can do.
[05:35:27] <alextsc> argh, git + windows + eclipse; that's the stuff. Wonder if I'll ever get it working. :D
[05:36:22] <member68> windows + eclipse + egit = piece of cake
[05:36:35] <alextsc> starts to explode for me once i touch it
[05:36:49] <alextsc> unknow exception while executing ls-remote command Oo
[05:36:51] <wjoe> hehe
[05:36:59] <wjoe> I started using smartgit on windows. it's pretty nice
[05:37:08] <alextsc> brb googling :P
[05:37:27] <member68> are you working on a fork? i took away push permissions from everybody
[05:37:38] <member68> *everybody working on the main project
[05:37:48] <wjoe> is there actually a project to work on now?
[05:38:06] <alextsc> working is a bit of an overstatement
[05:38:06] ### markerz has quit the server. (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[05:38:11] ### markerz has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[05:38:13] <member68> nope, we're figureing out github right now
[05:38:14] <alextsc> i forked it and try to make changes
[05:38:17] <alextsc> still cant check it out
[05:38:27] <alextsc> because of setup issues
[05:38:48] <wjoe> ah :/
[05:38:57] <alextsc> maybe i should reboot into my linux install :>
[05:39:09] <wjoe> I was worried then for a minute. I saw new commits on github, but hadn't seen any on redmine. turns out you just did them between when I checked
[05:39:12] <wjoe> still working fine \o/
[05:39:20] <member68> workflow should be: create fork, add fork to eclipse, make changes, commit changes, push changes, create pull-request, have pull-request approved by project maintainers
[05:39:23] <wjoe> haha. I do find linux easier for development. especially android
[05:39:56] <alextsc> yeah, also great to have a usable command line
[05:40:12] <alextsc> but the window manager situation is terrible at the moment  :>
[05:40:15] <wjoe> yeah, seriously
[05:40:26] <wjoe> kinda :/ I just went with xfce
[05:40:37] <member68> first world problems :p
[05:40:42] <wjoe> hehe
[05:40:47] <alextsc> I'm currently on KDE, havent used that in years
[05:40:57] ### rapidfyre has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[05:41:01] <alextsc> well it's so shiny, shopping with my girlfriend has less glitter stuff
[05:41:09] <alextsc> gnome3 bad, unity bad :>
[05:41:13] <alextsc> terrible QQ :D
[05:41:21] <wjoe> indeed D:
[05:41:41] <wjoe> yeah, never used KDE myself. bit much eyecandy, but beats unity/gnome3 at least
[05:41:52] <alextsc> yeah i try to tone it down
[05:42:00] <alextsc> just have to change over 9000 settings
[05:43:06] <member68> i like my windows task bar ;) no worries about window managers
[05:44:24] <alextsc> hehe
[05:44:59] <wjoe> xfce is about right for me. it works well enough, and looks fine. doesn't get in the way at least
[05:45:00] <markerz> If you guys are interested, reddit-dev has git pretty much figured out
[05:45:07] <markerz> Opps
[05:45:15] <markerz> Wrong window.
[05:45:37] <markerz> But I guess it still applies.

[06:22:55] ### RAWR has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[06:23:47] <member68> I think I need a grammar checker for irc. the more I type, the more errors I make
[06:24:14] <member68> either a grammar checker or more time to type ;)
[06:24:48] <Billd> I need to remember to disable bugsense from my development build. My logs are going to be so cluttered :(
[06:25:56] <member68> idea: Android app to slow down time...I'll put it on my to do list. that would be such a great selling point. take that apple!
[06:26:09] ### RAWR has quit the server. (Remote host closed the connection)
[06:27:01] <alextsc> :D
[06:27:15] <Billd> I'd buy that at $.99.
[06:27:15] <alextsc> slowing time; that seems to be an eclipse feature

[06:36:10] <lyrch> how many votes were submitted to the app poll?
[06:36:55] <lyrch> enough to give some choices or not enough to be useful?
[06:37:18] <member68> about 70 people
[06:37:36] ### markerz| has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[06:37:36] ### markerz has quit the server. (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[06:37:43] <lyrch> not bad
[06:38:06] <member68> enough to pick the first few apps
[06:38:38] <lyrch> yup
[06:39:35] ### zubsani has quit the server. (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)
[06:40:02] <anyonethinkingab> It would be great if we could divide the teams by friday
[06:40:52] <lyrch> that sounds easily doable if we choose apps today
[06:41:25] <member68> do you want to add 1 or 2 simple apps that people can work on individually to get to know android development? simple calculator for example. i'd put together a layout and people can write the code
[06:43:49] <lyrch> that sounds like a good idea, should the apps have comments in them with suggestions on how to complete the code?
[06:46:14] <member68> yes, but little to no pre-written code. for example: we can point people to onclicklisteners for handling buttons but we add the actual methods
[06:46:34] <member68> *but we don't add the actual methods
[06:47:30] <lyrch> agreed, i was thinking along the lines of comments pointing to tutorials the explain what they need and how it works

[07:22:02] <anyonethinkingab> looks good, who made that?
[07:22:10] <lyrch> member68: nice, simple and effective
[07:22:43] <member68> people can fork it, write the methods and can add functionality if the want
[07:22:52] <anyonethinkingab> set the start number to 0
[07:23:17] <member68> forgot about 0 ;)
[07:23:21] <anyonethinkingab> solution spoiler: then always do *10+(number), right?
[07:23:22] <member68> I'll add it
[07:27:27] <lyrch> just looking at that makes me want to break out my "learn android" books again, so i can remember how to set layout properties correctly
[07:30:01] <wjoe> android layout stuff is one of those things I just end up having to look up every time
[07:30:06] <member68> there we go: http://i.imgur.com/p8Uh8.jpg
[07:31:05] <alextsc> wow nice
[07:31:12] <alextsc> well done
[07:31:44] <member68> should be good enough for now
[07:32:19] <wjoe> looks good. is this going to be one of the projects then?
[07:32:41] <anyonethinkingab> haha member i meant that there was a 0 in the edittext when you start
[07:32:59] <anyonethinkingab> but that is java, no?
[07:33:12] <anyonethinkingab> oh no, nvm
[07:35:26] <member68> it's just a quick layout for a calculator. nothing fancy. nothing is optimized and i didn't really care for all naming conventions. i put in some bad coding pratices, too (like hard coding strings)
[07:37:06] ### markerz has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[07:37:07] ### markerz| has quit the server. (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[07:38:19] <lyrch> tsk tsk, we're supposed to teach good habits from the beginning ;)
[07:38:23] <alextsc> ^
[07:38:28] <alextsc> :P
[07:39:19] <member68> i know. i'll fix the strings
[07:40:20] <alextsc> hehe. yeah the rest doesn't matter. But strings.xml is basic stuff that should be shown, unless you want to search and move tons of strings later on
[07:43:46] <lyrch> though that is something we could catch if we are going to use a code review tool like gerrit (i remember seeing something about it, but i left before it was decided)
[07:45:10] <alextsc> I think we are doing code-review-light through github before merging commits
[07:45:35] <alextsc> a major codereview tool is certainly nice, but lets get started first and see how it works out
[07:46:19] <lyrch> cool, i've become a big fan of code reviews before merging. my last job was working in the stone age and at my new job i've seen the light
[07:47:36] <member68> i love gerrit. i don't know how to set it up
[07:48:00] <member68> if we could get that done i would go for gerrit any time
[07:48:38] <member68> github code review isn't anywhere near as nice as gerrit
[07:49:10] <lyrch> we have gerrit at my work, i'll see if i can get a tutorial from the people who set it up here. or at least pointed to some good setup docs
[07:49:52] <wjoe> is gerrit a thing that's included in github, or would that need to be set up somewhere?
[07:50:20] <lyrch> i think it would need to be setup elsewhere
[07:51:15] <wjoe> I could look into installing it on my server, not got so much time today though
[07:55:30] <lyrch> yeah it looks like a pretty serious time investment to setup, and, from a couple stackoverflow questions i've read, it could be tricky to setup with github
[07:56:06] <lyrch> it's not impossible, but the code-review-light looks like a good option for the moment
[07:56:16] <wjoe> yeah, I was just reading up on it. not sure how nicely it plays with github
[07:56:24] <member68> the cyanogenmod project has it setup. I'll contact them and ask them about it
[07:56:25] <lyrch> yeah
[07:56:32] <wjoe> sounds like a plan
[07:56:48] <lyrch> well do they run their repositories on private servers or on github?
[07:56:48] ### markerz| has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[07:56:49] ### markerz has quit the server. (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[07:58:50] <wjoe> I believe they use github, maybe mirrored elsewhere though
[07:59:19] <wjoe> https://github.com/cyanogenmod
[07:59:39] <lyrch> cool
[08:03:52] <wjoe> there is a code review plugin for redmine, but I have no idea how that compares to other options http://www.redmine.org/plugins/codereview
[08:07:06] <member68> in my head i have the following workflow: people add the repo to eclipse, make changes, commit them. after that experienced developers (and possibly the community as well) can approve or deny the commit.
[08:07:56] <wjoe> pretty much. by the sound of it though, if you want to use gerrit, code would have to be pushed to that first, then reviewed there, then pushed to github
[08:08:27] <member68> pushing to github should be automatic
[08:08:51] <wjoe> from gerrit?
[08:09:30] <lyrch> yes
[08:09:44] <member68> i think so. otherwise projects like cyanogenmod with hundrets pf pushes a day would stop because of all the extra work
[08:10:25] <lyrch> gerrit sits in between the developers and the main repo. when the code gets approved by another developer and the tests pass, gerrit then pushes the code change on to the main repository
[08:10:57] ### RAWR has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[08:12:39] <member68> that way anyone can add code, but only good code gets added. an issue tracker determines what direction the project is heading and what code people should write. people can assign themselves to issues to work on them. i a system like that, duplicated work is non-existant
[08:14:00] <lyrch> yup, and it prevents any bad code from entering (e.g. breaks other code, bad coding style, etc.)
[08:16:37] ### markerz has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[08:16:37] ### markerz| has quit the server. (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[08:19:07] <member68> alternative idea: a gerrit repo and we mirror code on github
[08:19:25] ### RAWR has parted (left) the channel.
[08:20:15] <member68> scrap that idea. i misunderstood some forum post
[08:20:30] <wjoe> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3724101/github-gerrit-hudsonjenkins-workflow
[08:20:35] <wjoe> the post on here makes some sense
[08:20:42] <wjoe> (though I'm not sure what jenkins/hudson is)
[08:20:57] <lyrch> it's a continuous integration server
[08:20:59] <lyrch> good stuff
[08:23:21] <lyrch> the second answer is the workflow we're looking for, so it's possible
[08:23:45] <wjoe> yeah, it sounds good. I think the issues of github and gerrit not playing well are mostly old news
[08:24:08] <wjoe> only problem is, it's a bit awkward to pull from one repo, then push to another. I guess git has some way of dealing with that though
[08:24:44] <member68> devs only deal with gerrit
[08:24:59] <member68> oh wrong
[08:25:15] <wjoe> would they pull from gerrit too though? surely gerrit would be full of unapproved stuff, unless it's branched somehow
[08:25:24] <wjoe> hm
[08:25:31] <lyrch> nope, they would pull from github
[08:25:52] <wjoe> that's what I thought, but then how do you pull from one repo but then push to another?
[08:26:06] <member68> eclipse can do that without problems
[08:26:12] <lyrch> i know that when i set up my workspace at my job there were a few git config options that i needed to set for the workflow
[08:26:39] <member68> so workflow is: pull from github, make changes, commit changes to gerrit, have them approved, gerrit pushes changes back to github
[08:26:46] <lyrch> bah, IDEs. commandline and vim all the way
[08:26:53] <wjoe> I'm sure git has a way to do it.. probably add another remote or something. not sure
[08:27:29] <member68> we'll figure it out. first we'd need to set up gerrit though.
[08:28:15] <wjoe> looking into it now
[08:31:08] <member68> great
[08:31:34] <member68> btw, i have to leave in about 30 minutes. I'll be back in 2-3 hours though
[08:33:09] <wjoe> huh, gerrit is a google thing? didn't know that
[08:33:38] <member68> i was quite surprised when the getting started doc linked to the android dev guide ;)
[08:35:27] <wjoe> I didn't realise until it crashed, and the package names were com.google :p
[08:35:46] <wjoe> http://lc8n.com:8080/ well that's not quite there

[09:16:51] <adamell> Good morning
[09:17:06] <veeti> hi
[09:17:10] <veeti> gerrit?
[09:17:22] <adamell> I see that we're still in the voting perioud
[09:17:29] <adamell> *period
[09:17:35] <veeti> hopefully that changes tonight
[09:17:42] <adamell> yay!
[09:17:53] <adamell> In that case i'll go have some breakfast
[09:20:13] <nataly> "tonight" - in what time zone?
[09:20:32] <wjoe> 13:13:27 < lyrch> interesting, what version are you using? 2.2, or 2.3?
[09:20:36] <wjoe> tried both :/
[09:20:54] <wjoe> [2012-03-21 13:20:06,978] WARN  / : Error in allQueryNext
[09:20:55] <wjoe> java.lang.IllegalStateException: Missing project All-Projects
[09:21:05] <wjoe> that's the error I'm getting
[09:21:11] <wjoe> (among other long stack traces)
[09:23:38] <lyrch> wjoe, i think we're using 2.2
[09:23:56] <lyrch> that's a weird error
[09:24:10] <wjoe> I've tried 2.2.2.1 and 2.3-rc0
[09:24:24] <wjoe> yeah. absolutely nothing for it on google
[09:24:38] <lyrch> i do know that we are using gerrit as the git repo also, so we only have one repo
[09:24:59] <veeti> huh
[09:25:58] <veeti> github will be used for the repositories
[09:27:04] <lyrch> yeah, but we've seen projects using github for the repo and gerrit for code review, so it's possible
[09:27:31] <veeti> i'm a bit skeptical about that
[09:27:38] <veeti> what's wrong with github pull requests
[09:27:43] <veeti> gerrit sounds a bit overkill at least for now
[09:27:56] ### RAWR has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[09:28:35] <lyrch> it is, but it's nice to look into for the future

[09:31:39] <lyrch> a code review will still have to take place for any commit, gerrit is simply a very good tool for doing it

[09:42:02] <slick8086> is that functionality lacking in redmine?
[09:42:50] <wjoe> There is a code review plugin for redmine, but I'm not sure how well it compares
[09:43:00] <lyrch> there's a plugin for redmine, but no one is really sure how it works. plus github does have the capability, just a light version

[10:30:33] <anyonethinkingab> kk
[10:30:36] <anyonethinkingab> ahm
[10:30:53] <anyonethinkingab> 74
[10:31:11] <anyonethinkingab> minus a few
[10:31:17] <itsKitsos> not bad
[10:31:17] <anyonethinkingab> let's say 68
[10:31:31] <anyonethinkingab> no not at all
[10:31:41] <anyonethinkingab> we got a decent amount of possible managers
[10:31:55] <itsKitsos> that's good because we have a decent amount of projects to manage :p

[10:42:45] <wjoe> one problem with redmine: everything uses real names, which don't always translate well to people's usernames on reddit/IRC
[10:44:09] <wjoe> so, if Alexander Boden is someone here: I've installed the eclipse connector plugin in redmine that you requested
[10:44:21] <wjoe> but I don't know if it works, can't test with eclipse right now

[11:06:27] <anjoyed> also redmine doesn't automatically pick up the extra repos
[11:06:36] <anjoyed> ony shows 1 out of 3
[11:06:59] <wjoe> yeah, they have to be added menually. also there's only one per project anyway (which mostly makes sense)
[11:07:16] <Hogofwar> veeti,
[11:07:42] <anjoyed> aye, makes sense
[11:07:52] <wjoe> I could add the others, but I don't think we really need a project section for IRC logs, and I'm not sure what the other repo is for
[11:10:01] <anjoyed> is here any way to have new repos under github.com/RedditAndroidDev added automatically?
[11:10:06] <anjoyed> *there
[11:10:24] <anjoyed> like github.com/RedditAndroidDev/projectName
[11:11:28] <wjoe> don't think it'd be possible. you can only set github to notify other sites for each repo. and as it is, I can only add a new one myself via command line, I have to clone the repo to my server
[11:11:38] <Hogofwar> wonder if they will allow a repo for the logging bot
[11:12:04] <wjoe> isn't that what the IRC_Logs repo is?
[11:12:14] <anjoyed> aye
[11:12:14] <Hogofwar> i mean, the source of the bot
[11:12:30] <Hogofwar> tht repo just holds the logs from the bot
[11:12:41] <anjoyed> that could be handy
[11:13:01] <anjoyed> if each project ends up with a irc channel
[11:13:08] <anjoyed> they can set up own bot
[11:13:20] ### AuthorityAction has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[11:13:52] <red_sky> yeah
[11:14:18] <wjoe> oh, did someone here code it? I assumed it was some bot that someone else made
[11:14:23] <red_sky> Hogofwar did
[11:14:30] <Hogofwar> oh hey red_sky
[11:14:35] <red_sky> using PIRC bot as a base
[11:14:39] <red_sky> hello
[11:14:49] <Hogofwar> red_sky, did something happen with your vps?
[11:14:49] ### markerz has quit the server. (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[11:14:58] ### markerz has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[11:14:59] <red_sky> I have migrated the IRC bot to a different server
[11:15:09] <red_sky> so it shouldn't lose connection anymore
[11:15:12] <wjoe> ahh. could be good to have a repo for it then. could just make your own repo, we can fork it into the RAD repos if needed later on?
[11:15:22] <Hogofwar> I could
[11:15:24] <red_sky> my vps has been dropping connection left and right... so I'm trying this new one out.
[11:15:38] ### member68 has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[11:15:47] <member68> !Upload
[11:15:48] <red_sky> since the transfer, the bot hasn't lost connection AFAIK
[11:16:06] <red_sky> try lowercase u
[11:16:13] <member68> !upload
[11:16:16] <red_sky> I'm not sure if it's case sensitive
[11:16:21] <member68> hello everybody
[11:16:24] <anjoyed> hey
[11:16:28] <member68> Uppercase worked earlier
[11:16:30] <wjoe> what's !upload for?
[11:16:30] <Hogofwar> it isn't
[11:16:34] <red_sky> ah, okay
[11:16:35] <anjoyed> !logs
[11:16:39] <Hogofwar> upload is op only
[11:16:41] <wjoe> !help
[11:16:56] <Hogofwar> only two commands
[11:17:04] <red_sky> just wasn't sure, because it doesn't seem to have uploaded.  the last upload was only a few minutes ago
[11:17:06] <Hogofwar> I'm gonna add in a 3rd one though
[11:17:18] <Hogofwar> red_sky, as i said, op only
[11:17:22] <anjoyed> you should have added !hogs
[11:17:32] <red_sky> Hogofwar member68 was the one who tried it.
[11:17:34] <anjoyed> make it slap everyone in room or something
[11:17:44] <Hogofwar> he isn't op
[11:17:49] <Hogofwar> wait
[11:17:50] <Hogofwar> no
[11:17:58] <Hogofwar> i just didn't scroll up my user list :P
[11:18:09] <Hogofwar> it shoulda worked?
[11:18:20] <wjoe> got a few scripts running in another channel, but most would probably be a bit too spammy for here
[11:18:22] <red_sky> let me check the config.txt
[11:18:41] <Hogofwar> sky17 pushed to master at RedditAndroidDev/IRC_Logs 2 minutes ago
[11:18:47] <Hogofwar> are you sure that isn't it
[11:18:49] <wjoe> things like dictionary definitons, google translate, unit/currency conversion
[11:18:57] <red_sky> hmm, mine says 4 minutes ago
[11:19:01] <red_sky> perhaps it is working
[11:19:03] <Hogofwar> red_sky, try having a different commit message if it is forced
[11:19:12] <red_sky> if I could find my source code, I had a really good translate command
[11:19:22] <wjoe> well, mine's just a java program
[11:19:31] <wjoe> then it's executed through some perl script
[11:19:34] <red_sky> I'll be home this weekend, I can try to get it then.
[11:19:38] <Hogofwar> red_sky, try having a different commit message if it is forced
[11:19:44] <red_sky> I saw
[11:19:56] <wjoe> source for most of them is on git.lc8n.com
[11:20:03] <wjoe> er, blatech.co.uk actually
[11:20:36] <anyonethinkingab> member68 have you filled the poll in yourself?
[11:20:47] <wjoe> tweeting from the channel could be useful for ops maybe
[11:21:23] <wjoe> I should probably fill in the poll. I don't really mind what we develop really :p
[11:21:33] <member68> not yet. i'll do it in a few minutes
[11:21:37] <red_sky> Hogofwar is there any way to reload the config without restarting the bot?
[11:21:47] <Hogofwar> No
[11:21:51] <red_sky> okay
[11:21:51] <Hogofwar> I can make that though
[11:21:54] <anyonethinkingab> i'll spam it again: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dGxpZ21UUTlvSHdPM3U5VWNUb1V3Vmc6MQ
[11:23:13] ### RadLogii has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[11:23:32] <red_sky> member68 could you use !upload again?
[11:23:32] <member68> i removed everybody but redsky from the irc log project
[11:23:36] <member68> !upload
[11:23:45] <red_sky> there
[11:23:50] <garychencool> I believe most of the user names on IRC correlate to the ones on reddit..?
[11:23:55] <wjoe> yeah, it's hard to keep track of the real names. it wouldn't be so bad if it actually showed their nicks when you click on the name, but it just shows emails
[11:23:56] <Hogofwar> Pretty much
[11:23:58] <wjoe> likely
[11:23:58] <member68> that way you shouldn't get any project irc bot related news
[11:24:03] <red_sky> yeah, mine does, and my github name is close enough
[11:24:22] <garychencool> well all of my names are the same (yippe), on this, reddit, github, redmine, etc
[11:24:23] <Hogofwar> member68, cool
[11:24:38] <Hogofwar> member68, is it appropriate for the IRC logging bot to have a git on the page?
[11:25:28] <wjoe> I'm surprised I managed to get my nick on reddit and github really
[11:25:44] <wjoe> not that it's exactly a common name, but it's 4 letters
[11:25:50] <Hogofwar> True
[11:25:52] ### sam___ has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[11:26:01] <member68> dunno. we could log to a ftp server instead of github if people wanted that
[11:26:23] <red_sky> I think that was the plan originally
[11:26:25] <Hogofwar> member68, I mean the source for the bot, not the logs
[11:26:44] <red_sky> but someone suggested github because of the infinite storage and because it's right there with everything else
[11:26:47] <garychencool> my name's my name
[11:26:58] <Hogofwar> wjoe, there are 456,976 combinations of 4 letters, so I guess that's pretty small
[11:27:22] <wjoe> haha. quite a few, but yeah
[11:27:48] <member68> hogofwar: i don't think we need the bot source on github. it's not exactly relevant to writing android apps
[11:28:13] <Hogofwar> 208 827 064 576         8 letter combinations
[11:28:27] <wjoe> maybe just make a repo for it on your own github page?
[11:28:28] <Hogofwar> member68, i'll just upload it to my own github
[11:28:32] <Hogofwar> wjoe, yep
[11:28:55] <wjoe> as much as I like hosting my own stuff (I have my own git server and gitweb here), github does look really good
[11:29:08] <member68> hogofwar: ok, if people ask I'll send them your way
[11:29:18] ### blaise| has quit the server. (Quit: Bye)
[11:29:22] <Grillon> feel free to post it here :)
[11:29:32] <Grillon> or just put your github name so I can find it there
[11:29:33] <red_sky> hogofwar, I'll probably make a branch pretty soon
[11:29:49] <red_sky> fork, maybe
[11:29:51] <member68> i still can't believe we have 500 people watching the subreddit
[11:29:53] <red_sky> depending on what you want
[11:30:37] <Hogofwar> Grillon, github name is hogofwar :P
[11:30:55] <Hogofwar> red_sky, haha what do you plan to add?
[11:30:59] <garychencool> I believe GitHub barley goes down? y/n?
[11:31:09] <member68> github is stable
[11:31:11] <Hogofwar> You guys also get to laugh over my terrible programming
[11:31:15] <red_sky> I can help with things member68 suggested
[11:31:24] <Hogofwar> red_sky, what things?
[11:31:27] <red_sky> like google translate
[11:31:31] <Hogofwar> oh, that crap
[11:31:43] <Hogofwar> So you are turning the log bot into a multi-purpose one
[11:31:49] <red_sky> oh, nevermind
[11:31:57] <Hogofwar> red_sky, i'm not against it
[11:32:05] <red_sky> wjoe suggested that stuff, haha, xchat gives him the same name color as member68
[11:32:23] <red_sky> hmm, you know, I like the idea of having extra features
[11:32:27] <Hogofwar> Hell, I already made a multi-purpose plugin-based IRC bot
[11:32:31] <red_sky> but with that comes the possibility of spam
[11:32:40] <Hogofwar> That supported Python + Java plugins
[11:32:45] <red_sky> hmm, not bad
[11:32:46] <Hogofwar> Holy shit was that a mess to code
[11:33:07] <Hogofwar> It could have been improved a ton though
[11:33:12] <red_sky> at the very least, perhaps I can look over what you have now and see if there's ways to improve what already exists
[11:33:17] <Hogofwar> Like event listeners of sorts instead
[11:33:28] <wjoe> oh, well I was saying I have some scripts in another channel for things like that. then again, it's kinda an awkward system
[11:33:36] <Hogofwar> red_sky, hell, just telling me how to improve would be tremedously helpful to me
[11:33:42] <wjoe> it runs java and C++ and all sorts of programs, rather than actually scripting it directly in perl
[11:34:04] <wjoe> but yeah, I was thinking those sorts of things might be a bit spammy for here, but I don't mind either way
[11:34:07] <red_sky> ah, that is weird
[11:34:16] <red_sky> I think it's ultimately up to the OPs
[11:34:34] <wjoe> yeah, none of us knew perl so we just wrote stuff in whatever language we felt like. as long as it deals with stdin and stdout, it works
[11:34:37] ### markerz has quit the server. (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[11:34:40] ### markerz| has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[11:34:56] <Hogofwar> red_sky, added a config reload
[11:35:04] <red_sky> nice
[11:35:12] <Hogofwar> gonna add the last command i can think of now
[11:35:14] <member68> be careful who can change the bot. i don't want a bot that replaces the word "app" with "kitten" everytime someone says it ;)
[11:35:20] <Hogofwar> Gonna rip it from my other bot
[11:35:35] <red_sky> I don't think it can modify messages before they are posted
[11:35:35] <Hogofwar> I hope to god I didn't write it in python
[11:35:39] <Hogofwar> I can never translate it well
[11:35:42] <red_sky> it would have to hook into the server itself
[11:35:49] <red_sky> which I think would pose a huge security risk
[11:36:01] <wjoe> haha. yeah, definitely can't do that
[11:36:15] <wjoe> I host an IRC server, but I wouldn't even know how to do it with that, let alone freenode
[11:36:35] <Hogofwar> wooo! didn't write that bit in python!
[11:36:43] <member68> it would confuse everybody who reads the logs later on: "let's write an Android KITTEN!"
[11:36:53] <anjoyed> :)
[11:36:54] <Hogofwar> Ah, the logs
[11:37:05] <red_sky> oh, right, the logs
[11:37:28] <red_sky> that would be hilarious, though
[11:37:31] <member68> at least let the ops disable it !kittenModeOff
[11:37:35] <red_sky> lol
[11:37:57] <red_sky> someone that I know had a plugin where the bot would just say random things
[11:37:59] <red_sky> it was funny
[11:38:22] <wjoe> write an android kitten, with your leopard?
[11:38:53] <anjoyed> forking kittens
[11:39:34] <member68> but if we put that into the kitten, we might get in big trouble later
[11:40:01] ### lacop has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[11:40:04] <wjoe> fork the kitten, then clone it, edit it's source, and push it?
[11:40:15] <wjoe> then someone else can pull it
[11:41:05] <red_sky> Reddit Android Developers, forking git repos one kitten at a time.
[11:42:20] <member68> lacop must be seriously confused right now ;)
[11:42:31] <anjoyed> was thinking that :)
[11:42:48] <lacop> hey guys
[11:42:55] <lacop> yeah a lot :)
[11:42:55] <anjoyed> hey
[11:43:01] <lacop> what's new?
[11:43:29] <lacop> btw, no idea who is in charge of redmine, I think member68 - I've added myself to the about page, I hope that's ok
[11:44:08] <Hogofwar> egomaniac
[11:44:25] ### aschneid has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[11:46:34] <member68> there are a few that have admin status on redmine
[11:46:51] <member68> but it's ok. good to have that list
[11:46:58] <wjoe> no one specific 'in charge' of it really, it's on my server but others have been setting things up. I think, if you've been given access to edit stuff, it's fine :p
[11:47:07] <lacop> I guess I joined a little too late so I wasn't there
[11:47:24] <wjoe> I should add myself to that list. I got stuck at trying to think of what my 'strengths' are :(
[11:47:24] <lacop> not that it's important, but it's nice to have a headcount and timezone info
[11:47:38] <lacop> wjoe, be sneaky, omit that point
[11:47:42] <lacop> nobody will notice
[11:47:42] <wjoe> haha
[11:48:02] <wjoe> Skills: Java, C++. Weaknesses: Java, C++
[11:48:56] <lacop> how's the idea poll going? should be 24 hours soon
[11:49:16] <member68> going great. at least 60 people voted
[11:49:53] <wjoe> is there a poll up for logos, or are we still taking submissions?
[11:50:09] <Raionic> Any idea what idea is leading the pack?
[11:50:35] <member68> wjoe: --> reddit sidebar
[11:51:25] <member68> Raionic, i'll find out, give me a few minutes
[11:51:29] <wjoe> well, doesn't entirely answer the question if there's a poll up somewhere else :p
[11:51:38] <wjoe> but I'll assume that means we're still taking submissions
[11:52:03] <member68> yes, there is a poll, link is in the sidebar
[11:53:34] <wjoe> I only see a poll for apps, not logos
[11:54:11] <Raionic> Cool
[11:55:12] ### markerz| has quit the server. (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[11:57:37] <member68> wjoe --> We'd love to see your ideas for a new logo. Submit there here.
[11:58:00] <wjoe> that's submissions, not a poll :p
[11:58:13] <wjoe> unless you're just counting upvotes as votes or something
[11:58:28] <member68> do we have a poll?
[11:58:30] <red_sky> so, can I re-emphasize that all of our apps should have common theming?
[11:59:15] <red_sky> for the same reason that Steve Jobs always wore a black sweater, it helps establish the entity in people's minds
[11:59:39] <lacop> red_sky, well, I agree with a common theme, but lets not make it an unique thing
[11:59:50] <lacop> just follow the design guidelines and it will be consistent
[12:00:24] <lacop> we can have our own little things to stand out, but keep the general look of the guidelines
[12:01:13] ### alextsc has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[12:02:04] <red_sky> I really like the guidelines
[12:02:10] <red_sky> but we can follow them and still be unique
[12:03:19] ### sam___ has quit the server. (Quit: Page closed)
[12:03:51] <lacop> red_sky, if you are bored and have some ideas you can make sketches / mockups
[12:03:59] <Raionic> I think it would suffice to require the logo be displayed on all screens
[12:04:12] ### LogiiBot has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[12:04:13] <lacop> but it'll probably be better to wait for the app, then do the UI designs
[12:04:15] <Raionic> Because you would design an app different from a game usually

[12:04:53] <Hogofwar> lacop, it's the log bot
[12:04:56] <Hogofwar> just testing a new feature
[12:04:59] <Hogofwar> and it's my own
[12:05:02] <red_sky> I could possibly do that... but not soon
[12:05:09] <red_sky> I have an exam on monday and a speech tuesday
[12:05:13] <lacop> Hogofwar, java?

[12:06:59] <LogiiBot> The log has been uploaded and is at:  http://sprunge.us/ZHhB
[12:07:02] <lacop> so you have a list of integers and want counts?
[12:07:06] <Raionic> Excel
[12:07:10] <member68> list of strings
[12:07:13] <Hogofwar> WOOOO
[12:07:15] <lacop> use a hashset, increment each key

[12:07:30] ### LogiiBot has quit the server. (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[12:07:33] <Hogofwar> Anyway
[12:07:44] <lacop> hashset.set(key, hashset.get(key)+1);} else {
[12:07:47] <member68> isn't there an app for that?
[12:07:50] <lacop> hashset.set(key, 1);}
[12:07:57] <member68> or some excel or word function?
[12:08:03] <wjoe> excel can, yeah
[12:08:08] <lacop> oh ... well, there is a unix tool that does that, forgot the name
[12:08:16] <wjoe> but, I'l rusty on spreadsheet stuff
[12:08:17] <member68> I'm kinda lazy right now ;)
[12:08:18] <lacop> but excel should do it
[12:08:20] <wjoe> *I'm
[12:08:21] <wjoe> hehe
[12:08:35] <wjoe> I'm fairly sure the function is just COUNT
[12:08:40] <wjoe> but you probably need to do something weird to give the total of each
[12:08:46] <veeti> if you're talking about the spreadsheet
[12:08:49] <veeti> form -> summary
[12:08:51] <Raionic> Yes just replace the delimeter with a comma save it as a csv then open in excel
[12:09:01] <wjoe> grep piped to wc would also do it in linux
[12:09:09] <lacop> member68, cat file | uniq -c
[12:09:13] <Raionic> Then you can count all "a" and all "b"
[12:09:21] <wjoe> ...ok, maybe something can do it even better
[12:09:53] <wjoe> uniq looks pretty good
[12:10:21] ### red_sky has quit the server. (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[12:11:30] <member68> you can edit the spreadsheet if you want
[12:11:38] <member68> ups, that was for lacop
[12:13:58] ### markerz has joined ##reddit-android-developers

[12:14:58] <wjoe> looks like people want to make a reddit app
[12:15:11] <Raionic> Woo hoo go tamagotchi!
[12:15:54] <member68> wjoe: i doubt that. who in their right mind would ever go to reddit, you know, with all the child pornographers and rapists there :p
[12:16:28] <member68> it's not like any of us ever go there
[12:16:56] ### joholz has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[12:17:02] <member68> but seriously, i thing the direction is rather clear
[12:17:08] <member68> *think
[12:17:18] <joholz> hola
[12:17:46] <wjoe> haha
[12:18:21] <wjoe> I just think making a reddit app is a bit unnecessary when there are lots already, and some (well, probably all) are made by redditors
[12:18:40] <wjoe> but clearly they're not good enough if that many people want to make one :p
[12:19:48] <member68> i think we could start with a reddit quick submit app, and work on a client later on. we can merge both projects later if we want to
[12:20:38] <member68> tamagochi sounds fun, we'll need some people who know how to create the graphics
[12:20:54] <member68> and a google tasks client isn't that hard either.
[12:21:17] <Sanit> Tamagochi sounds way too advanced for a first project
[12:21:27] ### tmoskowite has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[12:21:53] <anjoyed> added some eclipse/egit stuff to the wiki if someone that knows git wants to check it
[12:22:03] <anjoyed> http://rad.lc8n.com/projects/general-organization/wiki/Github
[12:22:28] <Hogofwar> anjoyed, add touch
[12:22:49] <veeti> git commit -m "Fixed bug #124"
[12:22:54] <veeti> commit messages need to be more detailed than that
[12:23:05] <veeti> and not just a reference to a bug number
[12:23:22] <anjoyed> yeah, I just did the eclipse bit below that
[12:23:42] <veeti> oh
[12:23:49] <veeti> i'll fix the above stuff
[12:24:29] <lacop> veeti, well, if it's a trivial fix to a ticket you can look it up by the number, but it should be a little more than that
[12:24:48] <lacop> ie, fixed ticket #123 - <how it was fixe, why, ...>
[12:24:49] ### garychencool has quit the server. (Quit: Page closed)
[12:25:04] <lacop> something short, more stuff can be said on the ticket discussion page
[12:25:33] <lacop> wow netbeans is sooo slow... takes like 3 secs to alttab to it
[12:25:40] <lacop> something went terribly wrong there
[12:27:00] <nataly> good morning =]
[12:27:33] <veeti> commit messages should be decipherable without an issue tracker
[12:28:14] <veeti> so a good example would be "Fix [short description of bug]" and "fixes #999" after that
[12:28:54] <member68> commit message have to include WHAT was fixed, but not how, when or why
[12:30:25] <member68> wjoe, any news on the gerrit error you had?
[12:31:06] <veeti> is gerrit really necessary
[12:31:09] <veeti> github already has pull requests
[12:31:23] ### vcarl has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[12:31:32] <Raionic> Btw ...that was just an example guys. Not a standard
[12:32:13] <member68> i tried it but it's quite complicated. it also requires very few people to approve all commits. with gerrit, we can offload some work to everybody who wants to help
[12:32:16] <wjoe> member68: not so far. busy day today, so I haven't had a chance to look at it properly. I've got a few ideas to try later
[12:32:33] <member68> alright. thanks
[12:32:44] <veeti> are you saying that pull requests are more complicated than gerrit
[12:33:02] <member68> based on my experience, yes
[12:33:27] <veeti> i don't really understand how you could come to that conclusion
[12:34:17] <Hogofwar> what is gerrit
[12:34:18] ### markerz has quit the server. (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[12:34:19] ### markerz| has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[12:35:05] <lacop> code review
[12:37:28] <wjoe> well, nothing can be worse than the code review system we had in one group I worked with - pastebinned the diffs and waited for someone to look at it in a week or so
[12:38:18] <member68> veeti: have you worked with both systems?
[12:38:39] <member68> wjoe: sounds like the project manager was an idiot
[12:39:21] <wjoe> old fashioned, at least. he had the right idea, having code review rather than everyone pushing commits to the main repo. he was just completely unaware of any systems liked this
[12:41:07] ### nataly has quit the server. ()
[12:44:36] <member68> gerrit is rahter new, too. let's give him the benefit of the doubt ;)
[12:45:43] <wjoe> hehe, yeah
[12:46:04] ### Esge has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[12:52:29] <Hogofwar> Hm
[12:52:42] <Hogofwar> Trying to figure out how to read a file line by line backwards
[12:53:18] <vcarl> best i've ever gotten is read it in and read it backwards from memory, or reverse it before re-reading it :|
[12:53:43] <lacop> Hogofwar, find some file handling class in java that has seek
[12:53:56] <lacop> seek to the end, then keep moving back for as long as you want
[12:54:12] ### markerz has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[12:54:13] ### markerz| has quit the server. (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[12:54:52] <lacop> Hogofwar, http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/channels/SeekableByteChannel.html#position(long)
[12:56:01] <member68> going by the preliminary results we'll probably start on the following projects: reddit quick submit, google tasks client, IRC client, alarm clock, as well as 2 simple projects for newbies
[12:56:05] <lacop> if you are trying to get last x lines from an irc log that should be easy, seek to -x*512 from the end (512 is the maximum command length for IRC, so that will be always enough)
[12:56:32] <lacop> then split by newlines and take last x (there could be a bit more if it's a lot of short messages)
[12:56:52] <lacop> member68, 6 projects?
[12:57:09] <lacop> how many people do we have? there is like 30 in the google group, much less on the redmine
[12:57:20] ### ballpointcarrot has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[12:58:35] <Sanit> I have a small bit done already for the RQS project. I'll upload it to my GH later tonight.
[12:58:35] <member68> that's actually 4 projects + two projects that can be done individually
[12:59:46] <member68> i put together a quick layout for a calculator app earlier. i'll upload it and people have to add functionality. i'll add comments to point people the right way so they can learn by doing
[13:00:02] <vcarl> lacop, we have almost 60 people in IRC right now, thats not half bad to work on 4 + 2 projects
[13:00:16] <lacop> vcarl, most people are inactive here
[13:00:49] <vcarl> yeah, but given the fractured nature of how all the different places were set up, it's not unreasonable that people haven't joined everywhere
[13:01:16] <member68> i think we'll have 30-50 active devs. some of them won't do much, others will do more
[13:01:29] <member68> if we have too many people, we can always add projects
[13:01:48] <ballpointcarrot> we do have a decent pool of projects to pull from.
[13:02:48] <member68> we have to remove tetris from the list though --> license issues
[13:04:05] <Sanit> Any license issues with Tamegachi?
[13:04:27] <vcarl> Sanit, i'm sure that's flexible enough that we could just call it something else and get by
[13:05:23] <vcarl> tetris is hard to do "differently" than the original and still have it actually be good

[13:16:15] <lacop> I'm looking for something cheap, I don't need a lot of bandwidth or ram/diskspace
[13:16:22] <veeti> www.intovps.com
[13:16:33] <veeti> amazing support
[13:16:37] <Hogofwar> lacop, what country?
[13:16:37] <veeti> usually replies in like 5 minutes
[13:16:38] <vcarl> i know red_sky has some stuff going
[13:17:00] <lacop> Hogofwar, well, slovakia, but there is not much local stuff
[13:17:07] <Hogofwar> k
[13:17:08] <lacop> for all I care the server could be on moon
[13:17:19] <Hogofwar> lacop, what do you plan for it
[13:17:38] ### wjoe has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[13:17:49] <lacop> Hogofwar, running some stuff for personal use - irc server, also an irc relay for myself, stuff like that
[13:18:14] <veeti> irc can be problematic
[13:18:16] <lacop> I need like 256/512 ram, maybe 5gb diskspace (+size of OS)
[13:18:17] <veeti> many budget hosts don't allow it
[13:18:35] <lacop> not even a relay?
[13:18:43] <lacop> or whatever it's called ...
[13:18:48] <veeti> well
[13:18:56] <veeti> i'm using a bouncer on intovps with their permission
[13:19:02] <veeti> their tos forbids all irc access
[13:19:03] <lacop> that's what I meant
[13:19:10] <lacop> hmm, that's pretty weird
[13:19:49] <lacop> but thanks for the tip, it looks rather good
[13:19:56] <lacop> I'll bookmark it for future research
[13:21:42] ### red_sky has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[13:24:28] <Hogofwar> red_sky, lacop wants you
[13:24:39] <lacop> rawr :)
[13:24:48] <lacop> just wondered what VPS hosting you use
[13:24:52] <lacop> looking for some tips
[13:26:00] <Hogofwar> I personally use amazon's VPS
[13:26:06] <Hogofwar> The micro tier so it's free
[13:26:41] <Hogofwar> not big enough for what you want though lacop
[13:29:10] <lacop> I guess I really need to put together a server and run it myself

[13:43:53] <member68> I'd like to get some suggestions for pointing people the right way for a simple calculator app. the layout: http://i.imgur.com/p8Uh8.jpg
[13:45:10] <tmoskowite> move the numbers to the bottom right
[13:45:12] <member68> i'd like them to figure out writing onclicklisteners for the buttons as well as how to use findViewbyID for accessing the result edittext
[13:47:54] <member68> any ideas how to teach them and maybe give them some comment-based guidelines?
[13:48:01] <RAWR> member68: Perhaps a button for decimal points? Or whatever they're called
[13:48:53] <Airheebz> may also want to put the numbers to start at bottom instead of top, seems off to me
[13:49:14] <RAWR> Yeah like on the numpad
[13:50:05] <lacop> member68, move the whole keyboard down, make the "display" multiline so that it can show some history
[13:50:51] <member68> ok, i changed the numbers
[13:51:07] <tmoskowite> Um
[13:51:12] <member68> remember guys, this is supposed to be an easy project
[13:51:18] <tmoskowite> make sure they don't stack activities
[13:51:30] <member68> it's target are people who have never written an android app before
[13:51:44] <lacop> well, they can start small
[13:51:55] <joholz> looks good
[13:52:00] <tmoskowite> you could have them use a content provider to share
[13:52:05] ### itsKitsos has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[13:52:09] <tmoskowite> their mathematical results with the world =)
[13:52:15] <lacop> lol
[13:52:17] <itsKitsos> How's it going guys
[13:52:20] <lacop> put in a facebook button
[13:52:29] <lacop> "share this number with your friends!"
[13:52:37] <member68> they'll get the layout, nothing else. some comments and guidelines, but that's pretty much it
[13:52:42] <tmoskowite> ok
[13:52:50] <joholz> sounds nice
[13:52:58] <tmoskowite> is include/merge too much?
[13:53:04] <member68> yes
[13:53:09] <tmoskowite> ok
[13:53:15] <lacop> member68, sounds good :) make sure to provide the basic app structure what will load the layout, with proper configs and setup guide
[13:53:15] <tmoskowite> Then you are set
[13:53:23] <tmoskowite> OOOO
[13:53:27] ### markerz has quit the server. (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[13:53:29] <tmoskowite> you could teach them
[13:53:31] ### markerz| has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[13:53:36] <tmoskowite> to build it in XML and in the activity itself
[13:53:41] <lacop> gotta go, be back in a few hours
[13:53:47] <tmoskowite> do 2 different apps that are indentical, but built differently
[13:53:49] <joholz> later
[13:53:51] <tmoskowite> identical
[13:53:56] <member68> this calculator is the easiest app, i have to think of anther one which is harder. after that they should be able to assist those who are already working on collaborative projects
[13:54:10] <joholz> you could teach them a ton of different things, which are all basic and all important...but this is a fine start
[13:54:55] <joholz> imo
[13:56:27] <member68> looks like there's a lot an android dev should have heard of

[13:57:11] <joholz> @member68, thats a good idea
[13:57:29] <garychencool> Back, now using androirc
[13:57:59] <joholz> we all missed you
[13:58:19] <garychencool> Not sure if trolling or serious
[13:58:22] <markerz|> Basic xml structure and activity lifecycle
[14:00:36] <markerz|> Does applicationstates include saving and restoring states?
[14:01:41] <red_sky> ah, sorry
[14:01:54] <red_sky> I was talking to my coworkers about a recent Washington Post article
[14:02:12] <red_sky> lcaop, I've been having issues with YardVPS
[14:02:16] <red_sky> lacop*
[14:02:19] <red_sky> so I can't recommend them
[14:02:41] <red_sky> I am trying out ChicagoVPS for the month
[14:03:24] ### fr3tles5 has quit the server. ()
[14:04:21] <red_sky> $7/mo (March Madness Deal), on ChicagoVPS, you get 2048MB RAM guaranteed, 50GB disk space, 2TB Bandwidth, an a virtual quad core CPU
[14:04:30] <red_sky> it's OpenVZ, but has great specs for the price
[14:08:30] <Sanit> I've started a Doc to plan the Reddit Quick Submit app. Add to it if you wish: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S3ac4dxseKTFrIhUJ0OWX7jXLvIbTf5ncFhSzLc1VuE/edit
[14:09:41] <member68> further planing should be done via redmine. i'll create a project there
[14:11:34] <member68> http://rad.lc8n.com/projects/reddit-quick-submit
[14:12:00] <Sanit> Cheers
[14:13:22] ### markerz| has quit the server. (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[14:15:07] <red_sky> I can probably get started on something next week.  I have a ton of things to do this week.\
[14:15:25] <red_sky> Though, I suppose I can contribute here and there.  I just don't think I can do the core framework at this point in time.
[14:19:14] ### wjoe has quit the server. (Ping timeout: 244 seconds)
[14:20:06] <member68> actual coding won't start before we have gerrit up and running
[14:20:21] <member68> i'll create the projects though so planning can start today
[14:20:22] ### markerz has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[14:22:51] <garychencool> Androirc has ads but I don't really see them
[14:22:55] <member68> please write me a pm if you need extended rights on your project (this means you want to lead the project or contribute more than the average user)
[14:23:06] <ThatPlayer> Morning people
[14:23:37] ### Avid has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[14:25:19] <red_sky> okay, I can do that
[14:25:29] <red_sky> at some point, I can definitely see myself leading a project / contributing more
[14:25:41] <red_sky> but as the school year is beginning to wind down, there's a ton of stuff going on
[14:26:00] <garychencool> I recommend adding it to the site, Reddit, information document, etc. If you haven't done so already

[14:34:49] <anyonethinkingab> link?
[14:34:50] <member68> *planning
[14:34:57] <red_sky> yeah... on redmine or github?
[14:35:02] <member68> redmine
[14:35:16] <veeti> Your request to join is added. The project managers have been notified.
[14:35:17] <veeti> uh
[14:35:22] <veeti> how does this work if the project has no managers :p
[14:35:53] <member68> admins have to accept you
[14:35:57] <member68> which i just did
[14:37:57] <member68> i have to think about what i'll if too many people apply for a certain project
[14:38:29] <veeti> thanks
[14:38:44] <anyonethinkingab> veeti are you the PM then?
[14:38:58] <veeti> huh
[14:39:13] <anyonethinkingab> project manager
[14:39:41] <red_sky> I found a solution for the redmine name issue
[14:39:51] <red_sky> put your nickname / username in parenthesis in your last name
[14:39:53] <veeti> there are better people for that

[14:44:47] <red_sky> close
[14:44:51] <Hogofwar> very very close
[14:44:59] <red_sky> looks like it's missing new lines and has some java code stuff getting written
[14:45:34] <Hogofwar> nope
[14:45:38] <Hogofwar> That's just lacop

[14:46:05] <Hogofwar> *it
[14:46:11] <red_sky> I see now

[14:46:39] <Hogofwar> perfecto
[14:46:52] <red_sky> well, perhaps it should be the last five minus 1
[14:47:01] <red_sky> the !paste 5 isn't useful, really
[14:47:11] <Sanit> have we decided on a standard for adding our u/n to our names on redmine? Some people have [example], some have (example) and some have "example"
[14:47:17] <red_sky> minus one meaning shifting every element back by one
[14:47:30] <Hogofwar> red_sky, how do I shift easily then
[14:47:31] <red_sky> I don't know, () or [] are better than "" I think
[14:47:40] <red_sky> it depends on how you're writing it right now
[14:47:48] ### alextsc has quit the server. (Ping timeout: 255 seconds)
[14:48:01] <red_sky> if it's a for loop, literally just subtract one from everything in the for loop definition
[14:48:10] <red_sky> minus the increment part
[14:48:12] <member68> please use ()
[14:49:31] <Hogofwar> !paste 5
[14:49:31] <LogiiBot> The log has been uploaded and is at: http://sprunge.us/gjYc
[14:49:56] <Hogofwar> Oh yeah, it is also the wrong frickin way around
[14:50:17] <red_sky> yeah, I was thinking something like:
[14:50:30] <aschneid> I wouldn't think you would want the actual paste command to show up
[14:50:40] <Hogofwar> aschneid, what i'm working on
[14:50:42] <Hogofwar> Anyway
[14:50:43] <red_sky> for (list.count - 1 - requestedNum; i < list.count; i++) print list[i]
[14:50:46] <Hogofwar> gotta go for a bit
[14:50:49] <aschneid> Gotcha
[14:50:50] <red_sky> with some error handling in there
[14:51:15] <red_sky> later hogofwar
[14:51:44] <aschneid> Yeah, but if you are just seeking backwards, you'd probably want to go to end of file, seek back 5+1 and then do your loop to output the five lines you wanted to paste
[14:53:58] <red_sky> aschneid, seeking backwards would log them in the wrong order
[14:54:11] <red_sky> unless he filled his list in the wrong order, too
[14:54:25] <red_sky> or did some weird things with indeces that I wouldn't recommend
[14:54:39] <aschneid> No...I mean, seek backwards 5+1, and then move forward using your loop.
[14:54:47] <shmup> member68: ah, what was the reasoning behind that?
[14:54:51] <shmup> not using github, that is
[14:55:09] <red_sky> we do use github...
[14:55:30] <shmup> no need to drop an ellipses
[14:55:39] <shmup> member68's message to me just made me think otherwise
[14:55:45] <shmup> in regards to me asking about the community member list
[14:56:58] <red_sky> we're planning on using gerrit, I believe
[14:57:02] <member68> we're going to use gerrit for code review. that way we don't have to add everybody to the github organization
[14:57:09] <red_sky> as an intermediary repository between git and the end user

[14:57:34] <red_sky> member68, I can probably host the gerrit system on my VPS if you need
[14:57:40] <red_sky> the new one has plenty of room for things
[14:58:35] <anjoyed> pain to migrate gerrit if you only keep that for the month though
[14:58:56] ### kiel3 has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[14:59:15] <red_sky> I have a feeling I'm going to keep it
[14:59:23] <red_sky> the bog hasn't disconnected at all since I've switched it over
[14:59:35] <red_sky> and it happened like 20 times yesterday on my other VPS
[14:59:50] <anjoyed> yep, sounds like that box was overloaded
[15:00:00] <red_sky> yeah
[15:00:02] <red_sky> probably
[15:00:33] <member68> wjoe offered his server as well and already started working on it
[15:00:40] <ThatPlayer> The chicagovps is still really good for price though
[15:00:41] <red_sky> okay, that works
[15:00:53] <red_sky> can't go wrong with $7/mo, really
[15:00:56] <red_sky> considering the specs
[15:01:14] <red_sky> I'm not allowed to do P2P stuff on it... but I don't do that with my VPS anyway
[15:01:22] <member68> if he changes his mind we could move it to your server. but for now, i think we're good. thanks for the offer :)
[15:01:31] <red_sky> no problem
[15:01:37] <red_sky> I need to justify the cost somehow, haha
[15:01:55] <anjoyed> its really good deal for those specs + ability to run irc bots
[15:02:26] <Hogofwar> back
[15:02:32] ### markerz has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[15:02:53] <red_sky> for whatever reason, there was a ton of "standard" software that didn't come installed on it, though
[15:03:04] <red_sky> like add-apt-repository didn't exist
[15:03:10] <red_sky> and nano wasn't installed by default.
[15:03:18] <garychencool> Brb

[15:04:07] <red_sky> had I picked one I'm not used to, I would've been in a world of pain.
[15:04:15] <red_sky> It came with CentOS

[15:09:25] <Hayes> and it's called a subreddit, not a reddit
[15:10:04] <member68> nope, official name is reddit
[15:10:17] <member68> can somebody send me the irc link. i'll fix it
[15:10:56] <member68> nevermind, found it
[15:10:58] <member68> fixed it
[15:10:59] <Hayes> Registered users (also referred to as redditors) may subscribe to individual reddits (called "subreddits" informally, but "reddits" officially)
[15:11:03] <Hayes> You are right, my bad.
[15:13:21] <red_sky> Hayes, get the fuck out
[15:13:42] <red_sky> you're coming into the IRC channel comprised entirely of redditors, and you're defining things like we're 5
[15:14:11] <red_sky> in fact, nothing you've said n the 5 minutes you've been here is at all positive
[15:14:16] <red_sky> negative energy isn't cool, man
[15:14:24] <Hayes> Haha, I was just pissed because as a noob, it was hard as fuck for me to figure out how to join the IRC again
[15:15:11] <member68> relax guys, it's fixed now
[15:15:35] <shmup> how much of what we claim we're using, we're truly going to use

[15:16:15] <anjoyed> guess we will find out in the next week or so, whatever naturally get's used

[15:19:08] <Hogofwar> Badly
[15:19:11] <Hayes> Is this a thing?
[15:19:15] <Hogofwar> turn log into list
[15:19:18] <Hogofwar> Iterate over list
[15:19:24] <Hogofwar> into another list
[15:19:28] <Hogofwar> reverse the new list
[15:19:35] <Hogofwar> upload the new list
[15:19:39] <Hogofwar> heh :P
[15:19:45] <vcarl> could you use a bash script?

[15:21:09] <red_sky> I don't think you need two lists
[15:21:18] <Hogofwar> red_sky, yeah
[15:21:29] <Grillon> damn blaise still not around
[15:21:34] <Hogofwar> Let me try another way...
[15:21:50] <red_sky> you can read the IRC log into a single list, and then forward traverse it starting at list.length - requestedNumLines - 1 all the way to < list.length
[15:22:03] <Hogofwar> red_sky, exactly what i was gonna do
[15:22:15] <Hogofwar> except for the -1 part
[15:22:15] <red_sky> < list.length - 1***
[15:22:19] <Hogofwar> I didn't think of that for some reason
[15:22:24] <red_sky> the - 1 part ensures you don't get the !paste
[15:22:25] <anjoyed> aschneid is blaise?
[15:22:42] <aschneid> Yeah...switched to my reddit nick last night
[15:22:47] <Raionic> Hog what are you trying to do with that paste command I'm confused
[15:23:02] <shmup> log x number of lines
[15:23:04] <Grillon> oh
[15:23:12] <Grillon> i saw your comment about imgur api
[15:23:27] <vcarl> you could take the number given and delete the oldest entry in the list if there are more than that in it
[15:23:28] <Raionic> In reverse?
[15:23:29] <shmup> is what i thought
[15:23:36] <shmup> i'm in class not really paying attention in here
[15:23:38] <Grillon> from what i read, if you just a apikey, there is no limit
[15:23:41] <vcarl> so as you're building it, it removes unneeded entries
[15:23:55] <Hogofwar> Raionic, no, but i have to reverse in code to get it properly
[15:24:04] <Raionic> Ah k
[15:27:03] <aschneid> Grillon, they have two different methods of calling...authenticated and non-authenticated (for API 2).  The authenticated gets 1000 credits/hour and non-auth gets 500.
[15:27:21] <Hogofwar> !paste 5
[15:27:37] <aschneid> But from what member68 was saying, doesn't look like any of the apps that are going to be currently developed would have need of it anyway.
[15:28:43] <member68> adding an api key later on is very easy. we won't hit the limit during development
[15:29:38] <anjoyed> not even close during development, the limits are quite generous
[15:30:23] <Grillon> aschneid, quick upload?
[15:30:39] <Grillon> or was that canned
[15:31:14] <aschneid> I'm not seeing where the apikey is mentioned.  In their API docs, they talk about non-auth versus auth.  Authorized uses OAuth or cookies.
[15:31:51] <anjoyed> sanits app needs upload to imgur
[15:32:31] <member68> those credits are based on ip adresses btw

[15:33:07] <aschneid> If you look through the conversation from last night/this morning, we talked about schemes to not have to use a server IP
[15:33:15] <aschneid> Grillon: [09:57] <@member68> going by the preliminary results we'll probably start on the following projects: reddit quick submit, google tasks client, IRC client, alarm clock, as well as 2 simple projects for newbies

[15:39:36] <aschneid> So, do we think we want to build an imgur framework along with RQS, on the chance it may get used in the future?
[15:39:49] <anjoyed> would be wise imo
[15:40:08] <anjoyed> wrap up some functionality that any project needing it can use
[15:40:28] <vcarl> that'd be the "right" thing to do, we/people could definitely use it in future projects
[15:41:47] <member68> good idea. it might evolve into a project on its own later on
[15:42:23] <member68> for now we can keep it in the RQS app
[15:43:10] ### aschneid_ has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[15:43:19] <Grillon> by looking at the examples, its easy enough
[15:43:31] <Grillon> and if its by IP, like member68 mentioned, we shouldnt have any problems

[15:46:44] <wjoe> Oh wow have projects
[15:46:46] <aschneid_> member68: that's a good start...and it would probably work for RQS.  I had some other ideas for browsing imgur and retrieval of files.

[15:52:02] <garychencool> I mean like without internet

[15:52:13] <Hogofwar> red_sky_, except a -1 when using big numbers...
[15:52:18] <red_sky_> get a router that supports an external harddrive
[15:52:19] <danopia> looking back at my log, like 2 hours ago there was "no route to host". interesting, because my firefox via the same host stayed up overnight
[15:52:28] <garychencool> Copy files from PC (Windows) to phone (Android) easily over WiFi connection only

[15:53:16] <lacop> sure blame it on me...
[15:53:25] <Grillon> you have to check anonymous i think
[15:53:30] <Grillon> and just put your username

[15:57:30] <lacop> member68, you seem like a responsible person, and since everyone seemed to ignored me - anything important in last ~2 hours? :)
[15:57:46] <garychencool> okay ive got es file browser, switched to LAN Shares and it's scanning for stuff, found a comp (mine)
[15:58:00] <garychencool> Tried anonymous, nope
[15:58:17] ### anyonethinkingab has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[15:58:36] <TheNumb> garychencool: is it a windows share or what?
[15:58:41] <garychencool> Tried the username without pass word, nope :( Do I need to do something in Windows 7?
[15:58:55] <member68> we created the first few projects on redmine and started discussion on both a Reddit Quick Post app as well as the SimpleCalculator app
[15:59:04] <TheNumb> member68: nice!
[15:59:04] <lacop> thanks, will have a look
[15:59:27] <member68> we also changed all last names on redmine to include people's usernames. that way we can tell who we're talking to
[15:59:42] <member68> but i think that's pretty much it
[16:00:43] <lacop> btw, Hogofwar: I was a little bored few hours ago so I started piespy - http://dl.dropbox.com/u/257451/%23reddit-android-developers-current.png

[16:01:13] <lacop> but it's just running at my laptop right now and I'll turn that off soon
[16:01:24] <lacop> so maybe you could run it with the other bot, just for fun :)\
[16:01:34] <lacop> it's really the most useless statistic ever
[16:01:36] <Hogofwar> heh, maybe
[16:01:41] <Grillon> garychencool, thats all I had to do
[16:01:54] <Hogofwar> maybe i will make the bot collect statistics and make a html page off it
[16:01:54] <Grillon> maybe just add a local user with name and pass
[16:02:01] <Grillon> and add permissions to that folder

[16:22:25] <member68> gerrit is for everybody. it's a system for reviewing code before it is added to the main app
[16:22:49] <lacop> yup, to avoid bugs, it's better if somebody else takes a quick look at each commit
[16:23:08] <lacop> member68, who will have the approval rights? just team leaders or the entire github team?
[16:23:25] <jaimeh> Yeah but there is no point for review if that same person can approve
[16:23:36] <lacop> jaimeh, they can't
[16:23:42] <Grillon> peer review?
[16:23:54] ### LogiiBot has quit the server. (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[16:24:22] <member68> admins, team leaders for now
[16:24:22] <lacop> also I think you can make it so it requires 2 or even more approvals
[16:24:38] <member68> I'll add experienced devs later
[16:25:03] <Sanit> Lacop: I just looked at the Google Groups now, never used it before. Looks good.
[16:25:18] <member68> I'll have to look at the system first. so far i've only been a user, not a admin
[16:25:21] <lacop> Sanit, it's a pretty mailinglist
[16:25:43] <joholz> so pretty much redmine will have the projs to join, just choose which one you want?
[16:25:44] <lacop> I like the web interface, but if you don't you can just use it through emails
[16:26:15] <member68> joholz: yes
[16:26:17] ### jaimeh has quit the server. (Quit: Bye)

[16:28:23] <lacop> thanks
[16:28:29] <CarstenCarsten> I never used google groups?
[16:28:39] <CarstenCarsten> How does it work?
[16:28:49] <lacop> CarstenCarsten, go here: https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/redditandroiddevelopers
[16:28:58] <lacop> and then click subscribe or something
[16:29:16] <lacop> and choose from the options - get each mail, get a digest once a day, ..., or nothing at all
[16:29:16] <jaimeh> irc client for android?
[16:29:31] <lacop> if you go for nothing at all then just use the web interface to read and reply
[16:29:33] <jaimeh> andchat is pretty awesome, I think.
[16:29:50] <lacop> if you use the emails, you can read it with your mail client, and reply to them like normal emails
[16:29:56] <member68> it was one of the most often suggested ideas, so I added it to the list
[16:30:12] <jaimeh> I suppose

[16:33:45] <CarstenCarsten> so, I am on Redmine, i filled out the spreadsheet, I joined google groups, i joined the github repository, i joined the subreddit. Did i miss something?
[16:33:48] <jaimeh> Can I get the form for signing up as a developer/project manager. I did the first one, but then a new larger one was made.
[16:33:52] <jaimeh> Where is the link?
[16:35:13] <garychencool> Okay so I tried SwiFTP Server with this tut http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/41583/how-to-transfer-files-between-your-pc-and-android-phone-wirelessly/ and it works! Now all I need to do is find out how I can access files on my PC from my Android phone
[16:35:25] <jaimeh> How do I join the github org?

[16:44:16] <Sanit> is there a way of discussing a 'suggestion' in the issue tracker? Like replying to it etc..?
[16:44:41] <member68> yes, people can comment on it
[16:45:29] <Sanit> is that the "Quote" button?
[16:46:39] <member68> look for an update button
[16:46:40] <joholz> tmoskowite, i cant find you
[16:47:00] <joholz> not on reddit
[16:47:39] <anjoyed> aschneid, you about?
[16:47:53] <aschneid> Yeah.
[16:48:01] <tmoskowite> on reddit?
[16:48:20] <anjoyed> any houghts on best way to tackle the imgur framework?
[16:48:24] <anjoyed> *thoughts
[16:48:31] <Sanit> Member68: thats the one, don't know why I said 'quote'
[16:48:55] <TheNumb> anjoyed: http://api.imgur.com/examples#uploading_java :D
[16:49:18] <aschneid> I'd say take a look at the code member68 sent earlier to start.
[16:49:59] <aschneid> I glanced through it briefly, seems like it is strictly for uploading and potentially only oauth, not anon.
[16:50:28] <aschneid> https://github.com/RobertSzkutak/AndroidExamples/tree/master/ImgurExample
[16:50:47] <anjoyed> cheers, gonna take a look
[16:50:51] <aschneid> I'll look at it in a little more detail.
[16:50:59] <member68> just added it to the issue tracker
[16:51:44] <tmoskowite> jaimeh: added in reddit
[16:51:47] <aschneid> Are we thinking of tackling browsing, image retrieval, etc right now?
[16:51:50] <tmoskowite> member68: what is the gerrit link?
[16:52:07] <aschneid> Or simply uploading and adding more functionality later.
[16:52:26] <jaimeh> Thanks tmoskowite
[16:52:28] ### RAWR has quit the server. (Quit: Leaving)
[16:52:47] <member68> it's not online yet. we're working on it
[16:53:01] <Sanit> this is for uploading images for the Reddit Quick Submit app
[16:53:17] <jaimeh> I am willing to manage or develop on a project. Whom or what is still needed as of now?
[16:53:54] <aschneid> Sanit: yeah, but we talked about potentially fleshing it to a full framework other apps could use.
[16:54:08] <aschneid> So, just wondering how far we want to take it right now.
[16:54:10] <member68> click on the current projects and see if there are any that have just me as a manager. those don't have a real PM yet. feel free to sign up for those
[16:54:18] <veeti> i think that you're overcomplicating things
[16:54:26] <veeti> just worry about fixing the app first
[16:54:41] <aschneid> veeti: is that in response to me?
[16:54:46] <veeti> yes
[16:55:00] <member68> start by writing the api calls we need. we can turn it into a real framework later
[16:55:12] <Hogofwar> Okay
[16:55:18] <member68> well, start writing when we have gerrit up and running ;)
[16:55:20] <aschneid> of course what I'm suggesting is more than what we need...but I also have some ideas for other apps that would use it i the future.
[16:55:20] <Sanit> aschneid: we are thinking of getting the app work first, then make the framework when we understand the api bettter
[16:55:22] <Hogofwar> What exactly are we doing
[16:56:09] <Hogofwar> member68, is the reddit quick submit a simple app with a form to write shit in or a "share" option?
[16:56:40] <member68> it's about sharing any content you want: mostly images for now though
[16:57:09] <jaimeh> Intent sharing would be ideal, no?
[16:57:14] <Sanit> images, links and self posts
[16:57:30] <Sanit> Hogofwar: both really
[16:58:06] <member68> it should support sharing from the app and accepting shared content from other apps
[16:58:23] <jaimeh> Is the google tasks client going to be just google tasks, or something more general to other cloud task services?
[16:58:46] <jaimeh> Like could we have drivers for different services?
[16:58:53] <Hogofwar> jaimeh, i would say just google tasts
[16:58:55] <Hogofwar> *tasks
[16:58:59] <member68> jaimeh: we haven't decided. join the project and start discussing with others
[16:59:16] <lyrch> where are these projects listed?
[16:59:25] <jaimeh> I just sent a request
[16:59:34] <Sanit> redmine
[16:59:47] <c0smic> lyrch: http://rad.lc8n.com/projects
[17:00:02] <joholz> tmoskowite, get pm?
[17:00:15] <tmoskowite> joholz: nope
[17:00:18] <lyrch> thanks
[17:00:50] <joholz> tmoskowite, whats your reddit id?
[17:01:14] <tmoskowite> i mean in here
[17:01:18] <tmoskowite> just PM in IRC
[17:01:29] <jaimeh> wow there is already a full team for reddit quick submit
[17:01:32] <tmoskowite> in reddit my user name is: atesc
[17:01:36] <joholz> lol
[17:01:37] <joholz> https://github.com/Joholz
[17:01:54] <joholz> ok, expect a pm on reddit too, i think i sent one to you
[17:01:54] <jaimeh> 10 developers should be enough for one app. I think we should restrict team sizes?
[17:02:05] <Sanit> any designers in RQS?
[17:02:54] <jaimeh> my current reddit username is: talented. I delete them pretty often, but may have to keep this one now...
[17:03:09] <artico> hello everyone
[17:03:34] <jaimeh> Hola
[17:03:35] <anjoyed> I can do some kick-ass stick figures
[17:04:04] <joholz> i can make some nice blobs
[17:04:07] <member68> I'm an expert at MS Paint. That's about it though :(
[17:04:12] <Sanit> welcome aboard guys!
[17:04:16] <c0smic> jaimeh: Yes, we're going to restrict team size on a per project basis
[17:04:31] <c0smic> I'm good with Photoshop
[17:04:38] <jaimeh> I am good with Gimp
[17:04:43] <jaimeh> lol
[17:04:52] <Sanit> any icon/layout work?

[17:06:49] <jaimeh> for android, I haven't done any design work
[17:07:00] <jaimeh> Mostly just development
[17:07:48] <jaimeh> Things are moving really fast. This is great. I have to get back to work for a bit.
[17:10:08] ### RAWR has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[17:13:10] <rapidfyre> Regarding team size, will only members of a team be able to submit code for a project?
[17:14:45] <rapidfyre> Because I'm on a team, but may not be able to write much code as I've never worked on an app like this before... it seems like I'm taking up a space for a "real" developer...
[17:15:14] ### Esge has quit the server. (Quit: Beware of the dyslexic Borg, your ass will be laminated)
[17:15:20] <rapidfyre> What do you guys think?
[17:15:27] <jaimeh> I would say that you should be able to submit patches to a developer that can submit
[17:15:32] ### itsKitsos has quit the server. ()
[17:15:33] <member68> good question. let me think about it for a moment
[17:15:36] <jaimeh> have someone manage and show you the way
[17:15:42] <ThatPlayer> Same with people who have less time
[17:15:51] <RAWR> Was thinking the same thing and that's why I haven't joined a team.
[17:15:53] <jaimeh> People need to buddy up
[17:16:23] <jaimeh> We should have people in this situation designated to someone.
[17:16:45] <jaimeh> a developer who is willing to provide little time to applying patches and advice
[17:17:02] <rapidfyre> We could have the gerrit open to all and the teams could just signify those people who at dedicated to the projects?
[17:17:26] <rapidfyre> *are
[17:18:14] <jaimeh> I mean it is pretty easy with git. You just have someone sign off on your code and that person submits it to gerrit for review.
[17:18:40] <jaimeh> We have gerrit setup?
[17:18:47] <rapidfyre> Yeah, but my question is regarding the team structure in redmine
[17:19:01] <member68> gerrit should be open to everybody. project assignments shouldn't matter.
[17:19:18] <jaimeh> Well in redmine, we should definitely define a new group for this.
[17:19:29] <jaimeh> admin should be able to do this
[17:19:43] <rapidfyre> member68:  Is there any point of teams then?
[17:19:43] <member68> i'm about to create a few groups
[17:19:44] <Hogofwar> godammit egit is confusing
[17:20:07] <member68> designers, coders, managers, etc
[17:20:07] <jaimeh> developing on windows Hogofwar?
[17:20:10] <Hogofwar> Yes
[17:20:10] <veeti> Hogofwar: I'd recommend that you just use git CLI
[17:20:13] <veeti> it's surprisingly simple
[17:20:15] <rapidfyre> Newbies
[17:20:29] <member68> i'll also add a group called "unassigned" or something like this
[17:20:30] <Hogofwar> I have another git program on my computer, thought I would try egit
[17:20:32] ### anyonethinkingab has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[17:20:39] <Hogofwar> It is confusing
[17:20:47] <anyonethinkingab> !paste 20
[17:20:50] <anjoyed> egit has worked flawlessly for me so far
[17:20:51] <Hogofwar> Let me make the project a git repository!
[17:20:56] <anyonethinkingab> mods only -.-
[17:21:14] <rapidfyre> Hehe good to know
[17:21:17] <Hogofwar> anyonethinkingab, what is?
[17:21:29] <anyonethinkingab> i want to know what we'r talking a bout
[17:21:39] <Hogofwar> That command isn't available for the main bot yet
[17:22:07] <member68> !Update
[17:22:17] <rapidfyre> We're talking about the usage of the team structure in redmine
[17:22:56] <jaimeh> member68, apprentice?
[17:23:01] <member68> sounds good to me
[17:23:27] <rapidfyre> where newbies like me could be taking up the space of "real" devs in a team and causing the team to before full
[17:23:37] <anjoyed> ooh, redmine mails issues from tracker to my phone. nice :)
[17:23:47] <rapidfyre> anyonethinkingab: what I just wrote was for you :)
[17:23:58] <anyonethinkingab> rapidfyre:  ya thans
[17:24:42] <rapidfyre> And now new groups are being created as we speak afaik
[17:24:46] <member68> damn, those permissions on redmine are complex
[17:25:06] <jaimeh> Yeah, I manage my own redmine. I know what you mean.
[17:25:07] <rapidfyre> No wonder people make a living out of setting up redmine
[17:25:35] <member68> http://awesomescreenshot.com/06f20yf82
[17:25:43] <jaimeh> Although, it is very useful once you have your defined groups

[17:27:08] <member68> jaimeh: suggestions or tips?
[17:27:08] <anjoyed> the internet lied to me..
[17:27:17] <rapidfyre> jaimeh: do you have rights on the redmine?

[17:27:26] ### Raionic has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[17:27:32] <jaimeh> First, knock off all creations and setting up of stuff
[17:28:06] <member68> jaimeh: can you help?
[17:28:17] <jaimeh> Yeah
[17:28:27] <member68> admin coming your way
[17:28:31] <jaimeh> Okay
[17:29:26] <jaimeh> Ever since this post popped up, I am on overtime with gf and work. lol
[17:29:31] <rapidfyre> member68: will the easy app ideas still be uploaded, or are these all?
[17:29:49] <rapidfyre> As in on redmine
[17:30:02] <member68> easy apps are yet to come
[17:30:19] <member68> haven't had time to write comments yet
[17:30:31] <member68> does somebody volunteer for that?
[17:30:52] <rapidfyre> Ah ok, I'll remove myself from the reddit upload team then
[17:31:43] <veeti> comments?
[17:32:08] <jaimeh> I am reviewing the permission right now member68
[17:32:16] <member68> have you seen my simple calculator ui?
[17:32:17] <jaimeh> Are we going to setup a new role?
[17:32:47] <wjoe> Sounds like a lot of stuff is happening
[17:32:59] <ThatPlayer> Seems just to be redmine setup
[17:33:20] <jaimeh> More like defining roles for people
[17:33:22] <member68> jaimeh: yes. we need roles for maangers, designers, developers, translators and apprentices
[17:33:25] <jaimeh> and how teams will be run
[17:34:01] <member68> they should have rather similar rights (except for managers and apprentices)
[17:34:31] <Raionic> Can someone add a description to redmine for each of the projects? only 1/4 has a description
[17:34:37] <member68> managers get all rights they need to manage their projects, apprentices won't be able to edit wikis, etc

[17:37:57] <rapidfyre> Can someone please kick me out of the Reddit upload app?
[17:38:17] <rapidfyre> I'll join the apprentice queue :P
[17:38:22] <jaimeh> member68, talking about me?
[17:38:38] <member68> no, talking to rapidfyre

[17:41:41] <wjoe> I might join the IRC client one, haven't had a chance to look at it yet
[17:42:03] <artico> wjoe: i don't think there's anything there yet
[17:42:17] <member68> pro tip of the day: don't open 1000 raw files (25MB each) at the same time in photoshop
[17:42:30] <member68> it might slow down your computer
[17:42:36] <Sanit> might?

[17:45:11] <member68> deliwien: done
[17:45:18] <deliwien> thanks :)
[17:45:31] <member68> jaimeh: don't know. at the moment i don't think we need them
[17:45:57] ### markerz has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[17:46:05] <Raionic> Hogofwar i feel like parts of this code could be recycled for the IRC project
[17:46:21] <Hogofwar> Raionic, well you might as well use PIRCBot for the irc project
[17:46:22] <veeti> jaimeh: is there anything you think a subproject would be used for?
[17:46:23] <Hogofwar> BAM
[17:46:27] <Hogofwar> 3/4 of your work done
[17:46:38] <Raionic> lol
[17:46:47] <jaimeh> Similar to working on branches
[17:46:50] <Hogofwar> Or Pircbotx but that is very different to pircbot but much more updated
[17:46:58] <Sanit> Anyone recommend an IRC client for Debian?
[17:47:00] <lacop> does redmine have milestones/roadmaps?
[17:47:06] <veeti> Sanit: xchat
[17:47:07] <lacop> that would be kind of like subprojects
[17:47:08] <Hogofwar> Sanit, maybe Xchat?
[17:47:13] <Sanit> cheers
[17:47:15] <lacop> to group pieces of funcionality together
[17:47:15] <veeti> lacop: yea, it does have a roadmap
[17:47:30] <lacop> bitchIRC is the best, if you like console interface :)
[17:47:41] <lacop> (not really, just best name ... irsii is good)
[17:47:49] <jaimeh> Although, for a mobile app, I don't know how useful it would be.
[17:47:57] <midgaze> You mean BitchX right?
[17:48:08] <lacop> I guess, long time ...
[17:48:16] <anjoyed> even better name
[17:48:19] <lacop> veeti, that should be good enough then, to plan releases and features
[17:49:05] <Raionic> Question, since we have 3 projects what do you guys think about having each project do a monthly (or whichever period) peer coding session on G+ in an effort to grow the community through learning ... if this is thinking too far ahead let me know
[17:49:30] <member68> I'd say no to subprojects for now.
[17:49:32] <member68> maybe later
[17:49:38] <anjoyed> they suspended me so meh
[17:49:53] <jaimeh> I agree
[17:50:01] <member68> Raionic: I like the idea. we'll see if we can do something like that
[17:50:02] ### Billd-Work is now known as Billd
[17:50:22] <Hogofwar> http://badazz25.tripod.com/index-bitch.html
[17:50:25] <ballpointcarrot> Raionic: a shared coding hangout sounds like a neat idea.
[17:50:57] <Raionic> especially in the initial stages of this perhaps G+ session for the framework headed by the PM would be beneficial
[17:51:17] <Sanit> See the eclipse synchronized coding plugin on r/programming the other day? 2 people could similtaniously edit a project like Google Docs
[17:51:35] <Sanit> wasn't released but awesome concept
[17:52:20] <anjoyed> would make pair programming easier
[17:52:32] <anjoyed> wouldnt have to share a screen

[17:56:22] <Hogofwar> What's the best license for my IRC bot?
[17:56:37] <veeti> MIT
[17:57:11] <Lilday> @veeti hey - whats the team like on the IRC app
[17:57:18] <Hogofwar> That seems to allow people to sell my stuff
[17:57:23] <Hogofwar> I would rather not?
[17:57:33] <veeti> well if you want a more restrictive license use GPL
[17:57:37] <veeti> but that doesn't prevent them from selling it either
[17:57:40] <veeti> Lilday: hi
[17:57:43] <veeti> no idea really
[17:57:59] <veeti> only the quick submit project has had some activity so far

[17:58:04] <Lilday> I could probably sign up to work on the design/UI
[17:58:20] <Lilday> busy for the next 48 hours though - Uni work really heavy for the next week or so
[17:59:07] <Raionic> Is it the last minute? If not you can blow it off. That was my decision making process in college at least lol
[17:59:13] <Lilday> @Danopia who has been working on the new website? it looks awesome :D
[17:59:31] <Lilday> @Rainonic yeah thats pretty much how we roll
[17:59:42] <Lilday> @Raionic hasn't been a good idea though haha
[17:59:54] <member68> lilday: zubsani worked on it
[18:00:04] <Lilday> ah - it looks sweet
[18:00:32] <Lilday> I'm thinking this:
[18:00:33] <Lilday> We're a community of individuals who want to work together towards high quality Android content.

[18:01:13] <Lilday> or something like that
[18:01:30] <Lilday> towards creating* high quality open...
[18:01:47] <Hogofwar> maybe I can do a modified MIT license
[18:02:03] <veeti> speaking of licenses
[18:02:08] <veeti> what are the rad projects going to use
[18:02:14] <Hogofwar> MIT?
[18:02:34] <artico> MIT all around!
[18:03:12] <Lilday> What about two options - if you download the free app you get some sort of restricted license (still a very open license)
[18:03:27] <Lilday> if you buy the 'donate' app you are fully unrestricted to do whatever you want with it
[18:04:44] <rapidfyre> Would you need to write your own license for that?
[18:04:58] <rapidfyre> @ Lilday
[18:05:08] <Lilday> I don't know haha
[18:05:16] <member68> i'll probably switch to http://freedns.afraid.org
[18:05:25] <member68> oops, ignore that
[18:06:26] <veeti> Lilday i mean the source code
[18:06:34] <veeti> what open source license it's under
[18:06:53] <sam_> What's up dudes
[18:07:26] <Lilday> hmm - I'm not very educated in that area so I'd probably ask around the sub for opinions
[18:08:43] <Lilday> haha
[18:08:54] <member68> damn, two typos in one sentence...where's my red bull
[18:08:57] <artico> i have a driver's license, but that's about it.
[18:09:12] <Lilday> me too
[18:09:17] <Lilday> and a motorcycle license in 3 days :D:D:D
[18:10:07] <artico> is there like a separate process for a motorcycle license, or is it just like, tacked on to your regular license?
[18:10:09] <jaimeh> member68, eat and sleep and you won't need it
[18:10:37] <member68> 11:12 pm here. sleep is a good idea

[18:11:51] <Hogofwar> fuckin hell
[18:12:03] <Lilday> @artico well - in the UK its pretty complicated. For a car license you need to pass a theory test, and a hazard perception (video) test. Then you have a practical driving test after about 15-25 lessons.
[18:13:03] <artico> ah, not that much different then

[18:14:32] <Lilday> @artico with a motorcycle - you do CBT (compulsory basic training) which limits you to a 125cc bike. You need to do another theory test after this Then - with a CBT you can take your Mod1 test (off road - in a parking lot with cones and stuff) and then (if you pass) you take your Mod2 test (on the road - like car test). This then lets you ride any bike up to 33bhp. You are restricted to 33bhp until you are 21, or f
[18:14:40] ### anyonethinkingab has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[18:15:08] <Lilday> But - I think in America to ride ANY size motorcycle - you don't need anything. Just an optional MSF course. But I'm not sure about that.
[18:15:27] <Raionic> I think it depends on the state
[18:15:41] <Raionic> But idk not much motorcycle driving in new york city
[18:15:46] <artico> haha
[18:16:27] <Hogofwar> is this okay? https://github.com/hogofwar/LogBot/blob/master/LICENSE
[18:17:15] <artico> now i just have to wait for a conversation about motorcycles in the UK, then i can drop some knowledge.
[18:17:36] <Lilday> hahaha
[18:17:40] <Hogofwar> artico, that quad bikes aren't classified as motorcycles?
[18:17:47] <Lilday> haha yeah
[18:17:54] <Lilday> ride a quad bike on a car license here...
[18:18:08] <Lilday> I'm pretty sure most US states dont allow quads on roads anyway
[18:18:18] <artico> i didn't think they did either
[18:18:32] <artico> though i have seen a couple odd vehicles, so i don't really know

[18:19:09] <Sanit> sweet. Irssi is nice
[18:19:18] <Lilday> That seems good Hog
[18:19:33] <vcarl> scooters require no special license, but motorcycles 125cc (i think that's the cutoff) need a CY certification
[18:19:50] <Lilday> @vcarl what do you ride?
[18:20:08] <vcarl> which you get by either taking a road test via the DMV or by taking a MSF class, and you need to pass a written test, which is like 15 question long
[18:20:17] <vcarl> 78 Honda CB550k, it's gorgeous
[18:20:23] <Lilday> nice
[18:20:34] <Lilday> I'm picking up a YZFR125 at the weekend
[18:20:35] <ThatPlayer> I need to start saving for a car, I have to commute to school in the fall
[18:20:37] <vcarl> also the MSF class is $25

[18:21:01] <vcarl> in total, training, license, bike, insurance and repairs on a 33 year old bike have cost less than $2500
[18:21:12] <Lilday> what?!!!!!!!!!!!
[18:21:34] <vcarl> got it suuuuper cheap off Craigslist, and it was in fabulous condition
[18:22:03] <Hogofwar> I only find hookers on craigslist :(
[18:22:09] <Lilday> It is costing me £1,700 for an R125. £250 on locks, £75 on boots, £140 on jacket, £100 on pants, £45 on gloves, £95 for license and £900 for insurance
[18:22:14] <Lilday> I don't know what that is in USD
[18:22:28] <vcarl> oh yeah, gear costs a fuckton, but i already had a leather jacket and leather boots
[18:22:40] <vcarl> they aren't specialized, but they'll save my skin (literally) in a spill
[18:23:04] <vcarl> i did the training with a buddy, he bought a $600 jacket
[18:23:34] <Lilday> £3305 GBP to ride an R125. With 1 years insurance.
[18:23:55] <Lilday> thats 5241 USD
[18:23:57] <vcarl> dayum
[18:24:02] <Lilday> $5,241!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[18:24:14] <Lilday> .../Wrists
[18:24:42] <Lilday> Yeah the gear is worth the money
[18:24:52] <vcarl> well i got the bike for $1200, spent $800 on repairs, $300 on insurance (but got $150 reimbursed for the off-season) and prolly $100-150 on gear
[18:30:19] <Sanit> right, I am a newbie with GitHub (used it a bit for myself, never with a team). I have a bit of work done on the Quick Submit App (procrastination from real college work). Should I throw it up on my Git Hub, or is there a way for me to make a new repo on the RAD page?
[18:31:21] <Raionic> Man ....... wish i was still in college to do that
[18:31:30] <Raionic> I just got back from work ...got a call now i'm working remotely again
[18:31:43] ### kiel3 has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[18:34:05] <Raionic> But to answer your question ... a repository must be created first for that project
[18:34:08] <Raionic> doesnt look like there is one
[18:35:22] <Sanit> if I create one of my own on my page, can it be merged?
[18:35:45] <Hogofwar> Tags are snapshots, right?
[18:36:09] <veeti> if we have the same definition of snapshot yes
[18:36:22] <Hogofwar> and your definition is?
[18:36:30] <veeti> well uh you know
[18:36:43] <veeti> you have a tag for each version
[18:36:50] <veeti> and that tag points to a specific commit revision
[18:36:54] <veeti> so it's basically a snapshot of the repo for that version
[18:37:39] <Hogofwar> Well since each revision is TECHNCIALLY a snapshot, don't tags just make the revision stand out more then
[18:38:14] <veeti> i think we're on the same page here.

[18:44:11] <Sanit> ignore the background tile.. I don't know what I was thinking. That is why I shouldn't be allowed design
[18:44:36] <Sanit> i'm gonna clean up the code a bit now and add some comments
[18:44:55] <ballpointcarrot> Sanit: fyi: the gen folder shouldn't be committed; it's all auto-gen code.
[18:45:11] <veeti> same with bin
[18:46:07] <Sanit> i'll remove them now
[18:46:16] <veeti> add them to .gitignore

[18:48:04] <Hogofwar> does .gitignore have to be commited?

[18:57:26] <anjoyed> break down into sections, add ticket for section and assign to whoever
[18:57:42] <anjoyed> or let anyone interested in a section assign ticket to themselves
[18:58:34] <member68> please use the ticket system on redmine. i know all of you want to start coding right away, but without the gerrit system we are a little bit limited in our progress
[18:58:43] <Sanit> shit. that command didn't remove the file on git, it removed them from my disk
[18:59:00] <lyrch> what command?
[18:59:25] <lyrch> if it was commited already do a "git checkout <full/path/to/file>
[18:59:35] <Sanit> git rm -r bin/
[18:59:47] <lyrch> hope it was commited
[18:59:53] <anjoyed> i cloned it here too so no worries

[19:46:37] <member68> which project?
[19:47:55] <adamell> member68: Any of the Reddit related projects or the google tasks client. They'd all be relatively simple.
[19:48:23] ### Billd is now known as Hiver
[19:49:45] <anyonethinkingab> i think we'll need 2 PMs for the reddit client
[19:49:57] <anjoyed_o0O> mylyn redmine connector is allowing tasks to be pulled from the site, but won't authenticate to update them from eclipse
[19:50:10] <adamell> If someone on the  creates a master branch one https://github.com/RedditAndroidDev (probably just a blank project) I'll fork it and get to work right away.

[19:51:03] <Sanit> you accidentally a word
[19:51:56] <adamell> Yes I did and I feel very silly.
[19:52:05] <Hogofwar> member68, kick RadLogii
[19:52:15] ### RadLogii was kicked from ##reddit-android-developers by member68 (RadLogii)
[19:52:15] ### RadLogii has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[19:52:21] <Hogofwar> heh
[19:52:23] <Hogofwar> still works
[19:52:25] <anjoyed_o0O> lol

[19:52:46] ### RadLogii has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[19:52:55] <member68> not a very creative bot ;=
[19:52:57] <member68> ;)
[19:53:04] <Hogofwar> :P
[19:53:11] <member68> but it works ;)
[19:53:20] <Hogofwar> Not exactly going to great lengths if it is kicked
[19:53:29] <Hogofwar> which it shouldn't be in the first place
[19:54:07] <anyonethinkingab> haha
[19:54:27] <anyonethinkingab> i'm gonna go, ig you want to be PM, contact 68, see you tomorrow
[19:54:38] <adamell> cheers
[19:54:42] <Raionic> i wonder how frequent IRC Flooding is now a days........i remember back when i was on IRC frequently (mid 90s) that was a common thing

[19:56:03] <member68> adamell, coding won't start until tommorrow as far as i can tell
[19:56:13] <member68> you can start locally tough if you want
[19:56:30] <member68> just pick a project, I'll add you as PM and you can start
[19:57:28] ### persona83 has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[19:58:22] <anjoyed_o0O> http authentication from mylyn needs and api key from redmine
[19:58:24] <adamell> Mobile Reddit App or Reddit Client would be fine.
[19:58:27] <anjoyed_o0O> or something
[19:58:42] <anjoyed_o0O> and -> an
[19:59:02] <adamell> in my mind they're the same thing, unless the descriptions differ.
[20:03:14] ### joholz has quit the server. (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[20:04:03] <member68> we decided earlier that a reddit client will be done at some point. it won't be one of the first projects though. We'd like to get everbody familiar with the general workflow before attempting a project that is as important to many of us as a reddit client
[20:04:21] <sam_> choose the google tasks app :)
[20:04:52] <Hogofwar> Done
[20:05:11] <Hogofwar> https://github.com/hogofwar/LogBot - is now fully, if not mostly commentated
[20:05:36] <adamell> LogBot is fun to say out loud
[20:05:42] ### smirk has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[20:05:51] <ThatPlayer> adamell: Lol
[20:06:42] <member68> anjoyed: you need an api key?

[20:12:25] <anjoyed_o0O> says http authentications needs an api-key from redmine

[20:20:15] <adamell> Finally!
[20:21:06] <adamell> I like how it lacks any html.
[20:21:06] <Sanit> :D
[20:21:09] ### smirk has quit the server. (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[20:21:12] <adamell> real pros
[20:21:18] <sam_> ^Why do we need this?
[20:21:19] <danopia> oh yea, that
[20:21:24] <danopia> i need to do the site
[20:21:28] <danopia> but it's finals week
[20:21:34] <danopia> tomorrow i'll have actual programming time
[20:22:14] <adamell> i was commenting not on the content but on the lack of any html tags anywhere. its just text in the source file.
[20:22:40] <danopia> i'll just pass it off as HTML4
[20:22:45] <adamell> lol
[20:22:52] <danopia> adamell, you know you can apply CSS without adding any HTML?
[20:23:01] <wjoe> anjoyed_o0O: hmm, I'll look into it. I set up the plugin earlier but wasn't able to test with eclipse at the time. not sure where the API key comes from
[20:23:07] <adamell> nope i didn't
[20:23:14] <adamell> makes sense though.
[20:23:15] <danopia> you can apply i.e. a logo image
[20:23:22] <danopia> you specify the .css file via HTTP header
[20:24:11] <Sanit> ayone here work in the programming industry?
[20:24:33] <jaimeh> I do it for a living
[20:24:37] <aschneid_> i do
[20:24:44] <jaimeh> anjoyed_o0O, did you figure out the api key?
[20:25:04] <wjoe> yeah. well, technically I quit my job today, and start my new one on monday :p but yeah, professional programmer, supposedly
[20:25:28] <Sanit> nice. Just wondering if we were all hobbists or not
[20:25:29] <adamell> What's your new job going to be?
[20:25:46] <jaimeh> I doubt it
[20:25:51] <wjoe> java/C++ stuff for a financial software company in london
[20:26:07] <jaimeh> Well I hope we have more professionals in here
[20:26:12] <Sanit> me too
[20:26:20] ### Ramuh has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[20:26:58] <wjoe> well I'm still a bit of a noob :p graduated in 2010, been in a boring job since. honestly I've learnt more in side projects like this than I did in my job or degree
[20:27:09] <lyrch> i'm a professional dev, some java, ruby, and c++ for a search company in pitt
[20:27:37] <jaimeh> I feel old already. 26 and have been developing for a few years
[20:27:45] <lyrch> same here
[20:27:48] <jaimeh> developing professionally
[20:28:02] <markerz_> I feel young an inexperienced. :(
[20:28:04] <Sanit> wjoe: nice. thas what im hoping for too. Plus a nice addition to the CV
[20:28:10] <joholz> im self taught java. i still haveto learn
[20:28:14] <Hogofwar> markerz_, heh, how young?
[20:28:22] ### smirk has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[20:28:55] <jaimeh> self taught is great. I like to see people with a passion, but also critical thinking.
[20:29:20] <markerz_> Hogofwar:  STRANGER_DANGER!
[20:29:23] <member68> good night everybody. see you in a few hours. need some sleep
[20:29:23] <wjoe> yeah, definitely. I probably wouldn't have got my new job if it wasn't for the stuff I've worked on in my own time. nothing big, but just showing that you're interested in learning and coding is something
[20:29:32] <Hogofwar> markerz_, yes little kiddie
[20:29:33] <wjoe> night member68
[20:29:38] <Hogofwar> tell me how OOOLLLDDDD you are
[20:29:45] <Sanit> later member68. thanks for all the help
[20:29:51] <Hogofwar> you are a big boy, you can tell me
[20:29:53] <adamell> night
[20:29:53] <member68> nP
[20:29:57] <lyrch> later
[20:29:58] <markerz_> Haha. 18.  I'm just a freshman in college.
[20:30:04] <Hogofwar> i'm younger
[20:30:07] <Hogofwar> BAM
[20:30:26] <member68> !update
[20:30:31] <Hogofwar> Also, freshman is the first year of college, right?

[20:31:12] <jaimeh> All of the great developers I have met have been messing with code around 16
[20:31:29] <Sanit> Sweet. I've a good start so!
[20:31:38] <Hogofwar> Apparently so do i
[20:31:41] <Hogofwar> *I
[20:31:45] <sam_> Means I'm on track for greatness.
[20:31:50] <Hogofwar> Or at least, starting to have a good start?
[20:31:57] <wjoe> meh, age doesn't mean much. I wasted my college years playing games :p wish I'd spent them doing stuff like these projects
[20:32:04] <Sanit> starting to start a good start
[20:32:13] <lyrch> same here wjoe
[20:32:38] <Hogofwar> Doing something is a good start
[20:33:35] <markerz_> <insert political joke about congress>
[20:33:35] <lyrch> yeah i figured i needed to give myself a swift kick to do something
[20:34:15] <wjoe> anjoyed_o0O: you should be able to get your API key from the account page now
[20:34:23] <wjoe> http://rad.lc8n.com/my/account
[20:34:27] <wjoe> just enabled it
[20:34:30] <jaimeh> anjoyed_o0O, go to my account page
[20:34:31] <adamell> Thank you
[20:34:41] <jaimeh> yeah
[20:35:20] <smirk> the window on your signup/signin websheet aint floating right hopefully not at too many screen settings. i can bareky view the top half of the textbox where i should enter the security string from the graphic. anything below that is gone on a wii internet viewing the page and prolly any 480 by 800 resolution and any phones
[20:35:49] <wjoe> let me know if it actually works. haven't even got eclipse installed right now myself, and it's getting late
[20:36:03] <smirk> bareley*
[20:36:05] <red_sky> hellooooo
[20:36:06] <anjoyed_o0O> cheers wjoe will check it out in a sec
[20:36:09] <wjoe> kk
[20:36:31] <anjoyed_o0O> member68 gave me a key to try few minutes ago
[20:36:51] <anjoyed_o0O> mylyn plugin is fecked since trying it, cant even read tasks anymore
[20:36:55] <Hogofwar> red_sky, fixed the bot
[20:36:59] <Hogofwar> red_sky, YOU BROKE IT
[20:37:00] <wjoe> ruh roh :(
[20:37:08] <wjoe> I've never used mylyn before. looks interesting
[20:37:08] <anjoyed_o0O> trying to remove the plugin and reinstall now
[20:37:11] <Hogofwar> red_sky, you said a ; in your text
[20:37:17] <anjoyed_o0O> its dead useful
[20:37:18] <Hogofwar> which didn't work in post
[20:37:20] <red_sky> oops
[20:37:23] <wjoe> this project is more organised than my job was
[20:37:24] <Hogofwar> utf-8 encoded now
[20:37:26] <wjoe> already
[20:37:31] <Hogofwar> red_sky, want the newest version?
[20:37:34] <smirk> you guys should try out your signup page on multiple platforms and resolutions
[20:37:35] <red_sky> sure
[20:37:43] <wjoe> smirk: which signup page?
[20:38:34] <smirk> hold up im on a wii
[20:38:36] <wjoe> ok
[20:38:50] <wjoe> we've got quite a few things set up, so not sure which you're referring to
[20:39:52] <jaimeh> This project is moving along better than expected
[20:40:11] <wjoe> yeah, sounds like lots of progress has been made today
[20:40:23] <sam_> A lot of progress has been made
[20:40:37] <sam_> We've started a few early projects, and cleaned up our Redmine page
[20:40:51] <sam_> We're basically all set up.
[20:41:26] <wjoe> it's very tempting to spend the next 4 days working on this. got a few days off, but I have lots of other things to do :/
[20:41:30] <smirk> yeah i gotta write the url from wii favorites then type it... i lost my laptop when i was hit by a car brb. im writing your nick down incase i loose the channel
[20:41:33] <Sanit> what are you guys working on?
[20:42:00] <wjoe> kk
[20:42:24] <sam_> YOU WERE HIT BY A CAR
[20:42:46] <sam_> HOLY SHIT ARE YOU ALRIGHT?!?!?
[20:42:49] <wjoe> currently, not much. poking around with bits of the redmine page. thinking of joining the IRC client project, but it does have a few people already
[20:43:22] <sam_> I'm torn lol
[20:46:10] ### RadLogii has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[20:46:18] <joholz> depends on pc, i would say
[20:46:25] <anjoyed_o0O> wjoe, worked oerfectly
[20:46:26] <Sanit> lyrch: even compared against the same spec PC equivelant?
[20:46:31] <lyrch> i have an early 2011, i just installed 16GB of RAM, never want another computer
[20:46:31] <anjoyed_o0O> *perfectly*
[20:46:35] <lyrch> yup
[20:46:44] <wjoe> eh, macs don't seem worth the money to me. when you say "PC equivalent", do you mean actual PC, or a laptop?
[20:46:48] <Sanit> laptop
[20:46:58] <smirk__> mjoe its the signup page from redditandroiddevelopers.com
[20:47:03] <anjoyed_o0O> can add tasksm comment and update tasks etc. from eclipse
[20:47:21] <wjoe> anjoyed_o0O: great :D thanks for testing it
[20:47:22] <Hogofwar> !paste 50
[20:47:25] <lyrch> the macs are expensive, but i've never had a problem with one. this is my second
[20:47:33] <Sanit> and how similar is OSX to say, debian?
[20:47:45] <Sanit> terminal wise. I live inside the terminal
[20:47:46] <lyrch> pretty similar
[20:47:48] ### smirk_ has quit the server. (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[20:47:56] <lyrch> completely then
[20:48:00] <adamell> Yeah
[20:48:02] <joholz> If you got the money, why not play with the mac?
[20:48:25] ### BrandonBolton has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[20:48:34] <lyrch> i fooled around with fedora on a pc laptop in college, but i wish i had a mac the whole time for dev stuff
[20:48:36] <jaimeh> Yeah not completely similar
[20:48:55] <jaimeh> There are many tools on debian that are non-existant on mac
[20:48:58] <lyrch> i haven't run into anything that was strikingly different
[20:48:58] <smirk__> u got that joe?
[20:49:07] <jaimeh> There are many
[20:49:19] <Sanit> hmm
[20:49:21] <wjoe> hardware wise, I'm sure you could get a windows laptop with similar specs for much cheaper. software wise, I'm not a fan of macs anyway, but I guess some would say that makes it worth the price, if you like it
[20:49:24] <Hogofwar> gonna go
[20:49:26] <Hogofwar> seeya guys
[20:49:27] <wjoe> smirk__: ah ok
[20:49:33] <wjoe> the link that says "add your info here"?
[20:49:33] <joholz> take it easy
[20:49:35] <lyrch> ah, installable differences
[20:49:35] <red_sky> lyrch, PCs are infinitely better for developing than mac unless you're doing iOS or mac development
[20:49:41] <red_sky> why on earth would you want a mac for development
[20:49:46] <smirk__> ill have to get a new lappy before i can sign up
[20:49:51] <aschneid_> Lyrch, how did you get 16 gb of ram into a MBP?
[20:49:51] <wjoe> that's a google docs page, so probably not much that we can do about that :/
[20:50:02] <lyrch> red_sky: i'm doing a lot of ruby dev right now so a mac is the way to go
[20:50:10] <red_sky> ah, yeah
[20:50:10] <lyrch> newegg :)
[20:50:13] <red_sky> you're right about that
[20:50:14] <markerz_> I actually wanted to develop for iOs but then I found out you needed a mac
[20:50:16] <joholz> it probably boils down to what your going todo the most on computer
[20:50:24] <Sanit> I heard somewhere that you aren't allowed to develop on windows if you are working for Google
[20:50:28] <smirk__> nah the main signup so i can login
[20:50:33] <Sanit> all their employees use Macs or Linux
[20:50:34] <aschneid_> I have never seen single stick 8 gb laptop memory
[20:50:41] <sam_> I'm sure it's all linux distro Sanit
[20:50:41] <red_sky> Sanit, you can use whatever you want at Google
[20:50:44] <anjoyed_o0O> wjoe, I updated that task and set it to resolved (from eclipse, woot)
[20:50:47] <markerz_> I've noticed that.  All the google demonstrations use Mac and Firefox.
[20:50:48] <anjoyed_o0O> cheers for help
[20:50:54] <red_sky> but linux makes the most sense, honestly
[20:50:56] <lyrch> red_sky: i had serious issues setting up dev environments in windows in college, it was a pain and not worth the hassle
[20:50:58] <joholz> markerz_ thats what drove me to android
[20:51:10] <wjoe> anjoyed_o0O: nice. on which project?
[20:51:11] <Sanit> can't remember where I read that, but it's somewhere
[20:51:14] <lyrch> linux is the best if you have a desktop
[20:51:34] <wjoe> same, dev seems much easier on linux. though, visual studio is hard to beat for the relevant languages
[20:51:41] <jaimeh> I have linux on my laptop and desktop. Well really on everything.
[20:51:43] <anjoyed_o0O> general organisation. ticket that was open for mylyn integration
[20:51:47] <lyrch> but you can't beat a mbp for a lap top
[20:51:47] <joholz> which you like better as a distro?
[20:51:56] <joholz> im usually fedora
[20:51:57] <red_sky> visual studio is definitely the best IDE I've ever used
[20:51:58] <ballpointcarrot> arch, hands down.
[20:52:02] <Sanit> http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/d2f3f04e-6ccf-11df-91c8-00144feab49a.html#axzz1pnp3o34D
[20:52:04] <smirk__> i cant click to submit the sign up it aint all viewable
[20:52:05] <red_sky> there's a reason it's more expensive than anything else
[20:52:18] <lyrch> i'm running ubuntu right now, simply because of driver support
[20:52:20] <Sanit> I'm on Mint at the moment. Fairly nice but I'm thinking of switching
[20:52:23] <red_sky> lyrch, I'd go Windows on a laptop
[20:52:26] <sam_> Personally, I've used mainly Ubuntu.
[20:52:30] <red_sky> 2x better specs, half the cost
[20:52:31] <red_sky> win-win
[20:52:32] <joholz> have you guys seen the, ubuntu for android, presentation?
[20:52:38] <jaimeh> smirk__, you will just have to use another computer if you can.
[20:52:42] <red_sky> I have joholz
[20:52:44] <wjoe> aha, I see it. nice
[20:52:56] <joholz> yea i thought it was cool
[20:53:08] <adamell> No emacs love?
[20:53:10] <lyrch> red_sky, i still can't stand the problems setting up a dev envrionment. plus i'm addicted to the unix terminal
[20:53:20] <lyrch> adamell, vim all the way!
[20:53:26] <jaimeh> unix terminal... *swoon*
[20:53:34] <red_sky> there's always cygwin!
[20:53:41] <joholz> red_sky its still in dev right?
[20:53:49] <red_sky> yes, joholz
[20:53:53] <wjoe> smirk__: still not entirely sure which page you mean. redditandroiddevelopers.com doesn't have a signup page on the home page, but it links to the redmine page and other things
[20:53:58] <lyrch> red_sky, no that is a travesty
[20:54:06] <red_sky> it actually works really well

[20:54:13] <lyrch> it needs to burn in a fiery pit
[20:54:24] <smirk__> watch change resolution to 600 by 800 or 480 by whatever i forgot. and try on other platforms... like the wii obviously :)
[20:54:27] <lyrch> i've used it, and i nearly broke my computer
[20:54:35] <red_sky> sounds like user error
[20:54:38] <markerz_> lollllllll
[20:54:40] <red_sky> just like anything that breaks your computer
[20:54:46] <lyrch> haha
[20:54:53] <sam_> OHHHH

[20:55:17] <jaimeh> I hate being a developer being called for support. 99% of the time, user error.
[20:55:19] <lyrch> i was trying to setup some wierd software that didn't come in the package, it wasn't worth the trouble
[20:55:36] <lyrch> i just went back to linux
[20:55:56] <Sanit> we use Suse on the machines in college, and is has extremely wobbely compiz windows with no way of disabling them. Pain in the ass.
[20:56:06] <wjoe> oh dear
[20:56:06] <red_sky> the thing I would do is, run Windows on my laptop, have linux in a VirtualPC
[20:56:13] <markerz_> I've recently started to browse read-me's and man-pages just for fun.  I've bastardized so many programs--it's sad.
[20:56:18] <adamell> I started using typewriters about a year ago and programming never was more fun and less productive.
[20:56:18] <red_sky> or just dual boot
[20:56:49] <wjoe> I just switch between linux and windows. these days, I mostly use windows for games, and linux for everything else
[20:56:50] <red_sky> adamell that's how I feel about mechanical keyboards
[20:56:54] <red_sky> except they are productive as well
[20:56:55] <smirk__> you see what im saying bro?
[20:57:09] <wjoe> smirk__: I still don't know what page you mean :/
[20:57:23] <joholz> i usually am on VMs
[20:57:32] <lyrch> red_sky, yeah this was a work machine that had 2GB RAM and a 1.2 Core duo processor, last year. it was bad, not good enough to reliably run a virtual machine
[20:57:43] <red_sky> ah, yeah
[20:57:48] <red_sky> definitely not
[20:57:54] <red_sky> linux LiveCD!
[20:58:01] <red_sky> (which are seriously awesome, btw)

[20:58:24] <jaimeh> liveUSB
[20:58:29] <lyrch> well i don't have a need for windows really, so when i built my desktop i just tossed ubuntu on and said "see ya" to windows
[20:58:38] <red_sky> jaimeh doesn't work as flawlessly as livecd
[20:58:45] <joholz> liveFloppy
[20:58:47] <red_sky> computers pre-2005 don't even support booting from USB
[20:59:06] <sam_> livePunchCard
[20:59:12] <lyrch> aha
[20:59:12] ### aschneid_ has quit the server. (Quit: AndroIRC - Android IRC Client ( http://www.androirc.com ))
[20:59:13] <sam_> ^Best thing ever
[20:59:15] <red_sky> lyrch, I like Windows because it always just works, and it has the best game support of any OS
[20:59:52] <joholz> ahh yess, where else would i buy all my steam games i dont play
[20:59:55] <jaimeh> 2005... 7 years...
[21:00:22] <red_sky> you make it sound like it's a long time
[21:00:25] <lyrch> red_sky, yeah games...i have a copy of windows 7 to run my steam games on, but i haven't installed it to dual boot on my machine because so far everything runs flawlessly in wine(which is a very strange phenomenon)
[21:00:25] <wjoe> joholz: on their website, of course!
[21:00:28] <red_sky> maybe in the personal computer market
[21:00:33] <red_sky> but not as far as computers at work
[21:00:38] <jaimeh> All I have to say is: daz loader
[21:00:47] <red_sky> just last year, at work, I saw a windows nt machine still doing important things
[21:01:03] <red_sky> lyrch I always get graphics issues and sound issues with Wine
[21:01:04] <lyrch> oh dear god
[21:01:06] <smirk__> theres a link after i enter to 'sign up or sign in' and on the popup window which i believe is an applet is where i cant see the whole textbox of the one where in suppose to enter text from a graphic
[21:01:09] <wjoe> wine mostly works... but even when it works, it usually doesn't work perfectly. I usually still end up rebooting into windows
[21:01:27] <joholz> whats horrible is the amount of people forced into IE6 in work.
[21:01:32] <red_sky> Wine with guildwars runs abysmally
[21:01:41] <red_sky> one of my favorite games... :(
[21:01:44] <anjoyed_o0O> all linux boxes for me
[21:01:44] <wjoe> I did go through a phase of trying to get everything working in linux, and never using windows, but in the end it was too much time and effort
[21:01:49] <jaimeh> wine with diabloII works amazing
[21:01:56] <anjoyed_o0O> haven't used windows in years
[21:01:59] <lyrch> i've seen horrors like that, i'm glad that's behind me though
[21:02:00] <red_sky> anjoyed_o00 how old are they
[21:02:04] <red_sky> the boxes at work
[21:02:04] <wjoe> easier to just boot back into windows for games, then back again after
[21:02:10] <anjoyed_o0O> old as santa
[21:02:17] <smirk__> theres a signup and or sign in link once i enter from main page
[21:02:19] <wjoe> I'm looking forward to my new job, linux at work \o/
[21:02:35] <red_sky> linux is much less fun without root / sudo ability, though :(
[21:02:37] <joholz> anjoyed_o0O: you should try it, they bring a nice style to your home
[21:02:56] <anjoyed_o0O> bright light :O
[21:03:07] <lyrch> my last job had a computer that the made an image of and put on a VM because the hardware was dying and the OS was no longer supported. the company that made it had died off 10 years ago, but it was a crucial piece of equipment
[21:04:32] ### aschneid_ has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[21:04:38] <red_sky> okay, I guess I should install eclipse now... :(
[21:04:51] <joholz> y u no have it installed?
[21:04:54] <red_sky> it's such a shitty IDE, but works really well with Android Development
[21:04:57] <red_sky> I have it installed in Windows
[21:04:59] <markerz_> o_O no eclipse et?
[21:04:59] <markerz_> yet*
[21:04:59] <anjoyed_o0O> i have much love for eclipse
[21:05:01] <red_sky> haven't needed it on linux yet
[21:05:14] <jaimeh> manually install eclipse
[21:05:19] <jaimeh> don't do the package
[21:05:21] <red_sky> anjoyed, it's *the* slowest IDE I've ever used
[21:05:35] <wjoe> I don't think I have it installed at all at the moment. reinstalled both my linux and windows recently, haven't done any home dev since then
[21:05:37] <anjoyed_o0O> really? flies for me
[21:05:38] <wjoe> red_sky: used netbeans?
[21:05:45] <red_sky> eclipse is just as bad, wjoe
[21:05:47] <joholz> anyone else get eclipse ocasional crash when loading javadoc/functions?
[21:05:51] <wjoe> not for me
[21:05:52] ### pocus has quit the server. (Quit: Page closed)
[21:05:53] <red_sky> both failed me during very important times
[21:05:58] <jaimeh> joholz, no
[21:05:58] <red_sky> when I needed them for final projects
[21:06:05] <smirk__> well i look foward to developing once i get a new computer. like i said i was hit by a car while walking
[21:06:16] <red_sky> eclipse always freezes for several seconds any time I let intellisense pop up
[21:06:16] <wjoe> netbeans at work was just painfully slow. eclipse was ok, but still a bit frustrating
[21:06:18] <anjoyed_o0O> used eclipse for years, no probs
[21:06:27] <anjoyed_o0O> last couple of jobs it was mandatory to use
[21:06:28] <red_sky> note the several
[21:06:31] <red_sky> like 10-20
[21:06:32] <joholz> red_sky, thats what i meant to say
[21:06:37] <smirk__> im on a fuckin wii right now
[21:06:51] <joholz> your playin wii?
[21:06:58] <red_sky> hey, smirk_ there's a car, look out
[21:07:00] <red_sky> *boom*
[21:07:11] <joholz> to soon?
[21:07:20] <red_sky> shit
[21:07:23] <red_sky> this download should be fast
[21:07:27] ### pocus1 has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[21:07:29] <red_sky> apparently my university hosts eclipse
[21:07:32] <jaimeh> red_sky, :/
[21:07:49] <aschneid_> Red_sky, have you used the newer 3.x or 4.x versions?
[21:07:53] <red_sky> yes
[21:07:55] <jaimeh> smirk__, get off the wii man.
[21:08:04] <sam_> Eclipse is the best IMO
[21:08:05] <red_sky> I've done android development extensively at this point, always using eclipse
[21:08:10] <aschneid_> They have taken care of a lot of those issues
[21:08:11] <anjoyed_o0O> for RAD stuff, eclipse + egit + mylyn redmine plugin
[21:08:11] <red_sky> all java IDEs suck
[21:08:15] <red_sky> because they're all written in java
[21:08:17] <smirk__> no im using wii's browser to access this channel through my verizon internet router
[21:08:21] <red_sky> which is a slow language
[21:08:34] <joholz> what i dont like is the android emulator
[21:08:34] <jaimeh> git gui people. It is built in
[21:08:43] <aschneid_> Never had any probkems with slowness
[21:08:44] <lyrch> red_sky, just throw enough ram at it and it's fine
[21:08:52] <red_sky> joholz the android emulator is a real emulator
[21:08:54] <red_sky> which is why it's slow
[21:08:58] ### markerz has quit the server. (Ping timeout: 248 seconds)
[21:09:01] <joholz> whats ram you usually throw?
[21:09:08] <red_sky> lyrch I have 8GB
[21:09:10] <red_sky> should be plenty
[21:09:11] <smirk__> my lappy is broke along with my legs
[21:09:12] <sam_> I usually just grab a chunk
[21:09:17] <sam_> And throw it at the screen
[21:09:18] <lyrch> yup
[21:09:19] <red_sky> if an IDE uses more than a gig, it's doing something wrong
[21:09:24] <wjoe> you'd probably do better using your phone for IRC than a wii
[21:09:25] <lyrch>  8GB and no less
[21:09:26] <aschneid_> Have you seen the new x86 based emulator?
[21:09:26] <joholz> haha ill try
[21:09:33] <wjoe> (assuming you have an android phone if you're here anyway)
[21:09:47] <red_sky> I can't get the system image to load, aschneid_
[21:09:55] <red_sky> for the x86 image
[21:10:07] <red_sky> the emulator is the same, it just has a different system image than the typical arm ones
[21:10:14] <aschneid_> I havent tried it yet either. Will have to give it a try
[21:10:17] <wjoe> and I don't know how eclipse is so slow for you. only time I run into major problems like that is when I'm out of RAM (which was often when trying to do dev on a machine with 2GB)
[21:10:28] <lyrch> ouch
[21:10:51] <anjoyed_o0O> aye, flies for me
[21:10:54] <wjoe> yeah. firefox, eclipse, netbeans, tomcat server, and that's pretty much all gone already
[21:11:06] <red_sky> maybe it will be better on linux
[21:11:06] <smirk__> oh shit.... is there an android emulator for windows or do i have to partition ?
[21:11:11] <red_sky> but on windows it is slow
[21:11:13] <lyrch> nope
[21:11:13] <red_sky> and fucking useless
[21:11:17] <lyrch> still slow
[21:11:21] <wjoe> yeah, the emulator works on windows
[21:11:29] <anjoyed_o0O> i think i see the problem :)
[21:11:30] ### persona83 has quit the server. (Quit: Page closed)
[21:11:33] <red_sky> I'm talking about eclipse, btw
[21:11:46] <wjoe> crossed conversations :p
[21:11:52] <lyrch> yup
[21:11:59] <smirk__> what do i use for a touch screen?
[21:12:08] <joholz> mouse
[21:12:08] <lyrch> red_sky 8GB is plenty for eclipse in linux
[21:12:10] <wjoe> in the emulator? the mouse
[21:12:23] <smirk__> i see
[21:12:27] <joholz> now and then it enjoys tounge
[21:12:34] <Sanit> i am running eclipse in linux with 2GB with only miiiiinor glitchs
[21:13:21] <anjoyed_o0O> windows build must be bit shit
[21:13:23] <smirk__> thatll be perfect till i get an android device
[21:13:44] <joholz> yea, should def be enough
[21:13:51] <smirk__> thanks whoever brought that up
[21:14:28] <wjoe> well, it's quite slow. depends what sort of app you're working on too, you can't test everything in the emulator, but usually it does the job
[21:15:01] <lyrch> test in the emulator, tsk tsk. unit testing is the way to go
[21:15:24] <Sanit> anyone else use adbWireless?
[21:15:26] <red_sky> unit testing is a PITA to set up
[21:15:31] <red_sky> Sanit I have in the past
[21:15:33] <lyrch> most logic can be tested outside the emulator
[21:15:47] <lyrch> sometimes, but always worth the effort
[21:15:50] <sam_> I've used adbWireless
[21:15:56] <sam_> Pretty damn useful
[21:15:56] <anjoyed_o0O> androids test suite based on junit?
[21:16:01] <Sanit> love it. Pratically no battery drain and worked with no hassle
[21:16:04] <lyrch> yup
[21:16:07] <wjoe> well, unit testing doesn't work for everything
[21:16:07] <anjoyed_o0O> have yet to use the android stuff
[21:16:12] <smirk__> word, i just need something so i aint gotta use my mommas tablet every time i go debugging
[21:16:18] <red_sky> unit testing would be extremely stupid for anything we do
[21:16:23] <lyrch> it's interesting to learn, but you can also run regular junit tests as well
[21:16:27] <red_sky> it's better for bigger programs
[21:16:32] <wjoe> android is another thing that seems to work much, much better in linux
[21:16:38] <red_sky> definitely wjoe
[21:16:45] <red_sky> you can't even compile android on windowsw
[21:16:48] <anjoyed_o0O> unit testing is always a good idea
[21:17:04] <wjoe> half of the time, I can't even tether my phone on windows. it doesn't play nice with the drivers
[21:17:05] <anjoyed_o0O> can be a bit of a pain but worth the hassle
[21:17:15] <wjoe> on linux, I don't think I even needed to install drivers
[21:17:17] <red_sky> not when it would take just as long to set up the unit testing as it would be to finish the app in question
[21:17:20] <red_sky> then it's stupid
[21:17:23] <smirk__> so i should use the emulator in linux
[21:17:25] <red_sky> resources better spent elsewhere
[21:17:30] <smirk__> ?
[21:17:32] <aschneid_> Anjoyed: agree. Especially if people ewamt to learn
[21:17:33] <lyrch> for anyone with a tablet checkut AIDE in the market(Play Store)
[21:17:43] <aschneid_> Want. Damn phone
[21:17:54] <joholz> smirk_ i think emul comes with sdk lib
[21:17:56] <lyrch> it's a ide that works on android so you can develope in it
[21:17:58] <anjoyed_o0O> dont know about that. bette to write the tests before the classes in all honesty
[21:18:03] <anjoyed_o0O> *better
[21:18:06] <lyrch> ^ this
[21:18:15] <wjoe> smirk__: you don't have to, it's all cross platform. if you know linux, then it's probably better to do android dev in linux, but don't worry about learning linux just for that
[21:18:15] <lyrch> TDD is the way to go
[21:18:19] <aschneid_> Tdd is very good
[21:18:36] <lyrch> it's hard to get used to if you've learned bad habits though
[21:18:55] <anjoyed_o0O> aye, bit of a brainmelt at first
[21:19:02] <red_sky> I don't agree with taking the time to do something when the time is better spent elsewhere
[21:19:03] <smirk__> soooo you caaan dev android from in an android?
[21:19:10] <red_sky> in larger products, it's a good idea
[21:19:12] <lyrch> smirk__ yup
[21:19:12] <joholz> someone inform me of tdd?
[21:19:20] <anjoyed_o0O> test driven development
[21:19:22] <lyrch> red_sky, it's always a good idea
[21:19:22] <jaimeh> Good luck getting a group of random developers to do it. If we commit to TDD we need something in the wiki, explaining like were 5.
[21:19:29] <red_sky> in smaller products, like what we're probably going to do, you'll spend just as much if not more time setting up unit testing
[21:19:31] <lyrch> use gerrit
[21:19:33] <wjoe> it's possible, but I don't know how well it works
[21:19:33] <red_sky> than making the product
[21:19:33] <joholz> thx anjoyed
[21:19:47] <lyrch> no commit makes it through gerrit without tests
[21:19:49] <joholz> smirk_ lookup AIDE
[21:20:01] <smirk__> thanx for the infoz guys
[21:20:04] <anjoyed_o0O> aye red_sky, but you save much time later
[21:20:12] <lyrch> and headache
[21:20:14] <joholz> np
[21:20:24] <red_sky> that's why I think it's better for larger apps anjoyed, because smaller apps are super easy to debug
[21:20:38] <red_sky> generally less abstraction, less complexity, less code
[21:20:51] <lyrch> never assume that something will be super easy to debug, it won't be
[21:20:55] <jaimeh> IF we do TDD, somebody needs to write a wiki page for it.
[21:21:02] <red_sky> I'm not assuming
[21:21:08] <red_sky> I'm comparing it to larger app development
[21:21:19] <anjoyed_o0O> its a good practise to get used to though. If you get in the habit of well tested code, you will struggle less on bigger projects
[21:21:21] <red_sky> it will always be easier to debug smaller amounts of code than larger
[21:21:49] <lyrch> true, but the need for practice is still there, and just as important
[21:22:00] <jaimeh> Beginner developers... test driven development is getting more popular. Learn if you plan on getting a job.
[21:22:08] <smirk__> the size of the app effects the way its runnning?
[21:22:20] <lyrch> jaimeh, very true
[21:22:22] <red_sky> app size isn't really an issue
[21:22:31] <red_sky> google increased the limits to 2GB for an apk, I think
[21:22:36] <lyrch> yup
[21:22:38] <red_sky> and the unit tests don't make it to the apk
[21:22:41] <lyrch> for game devs
[21:23:07] <lyrch> red_sky, still important for adding features, fixing bugs
[21:23:24] <jaimeh> Lyrch do you have plenty of experience with TDD on android?
[21:23:32] <lyrch> also the tests are a great way to learn a project if you are coming into an existing project
[21:23:34] <red_sky> lyrch, I'm not sure what you're referring to
[21:23:36] <smirk__> is it the location of like the `do events if such and such happens?
[21:23:46] <red_sky> "still important for adding features, fixing bugs"
[21:23:50] <lyrch> jaimeh, i've been giving it a try
[21:23:56] <smirk__> in the xode?
[21:24:07] <smirk__> code
[21:24:11] <jaimeh> Does anybody do TDD professionally here on android?
[21:24:11] <aschneid_> Jaimeh: you can still unit test without TDD
[21:24:32] <smirk__> whats tdd?
[21:24:47] <lyrch> red_sky, when adding new features and fixing bugs the tests will tell you if your new code will work properly with the existing code base, and for bugs it shows you where the code is healthy, and every bug should get a test to prevent it in the future
[21:25:13] <smirk__> ohhh
[21:25:20] <lyrch> jaimeh, my company is really pushing it, and i'm incorporating it more and more personally
[21:25:22] <smirk__> thnx
[21:25:44] <red_sky> hmm, I feel like either your response was really delayed or you misinterpreted something I said
[21:25:51] <red_sky> because I never denied that point
[21:25:51] <Sanit> got a bit of work done on Reddit Quick Submit. Activity switching works now and the XML layouts are roughly done
[21:25:52] <lyrch> perhaps
[21:26:12] <jaimeh> Do you think you can write a wiki page for everyone planning to develop. At least for unit tests. At least we can seed the idea to getting it done on our projects
[21:26:16] <aschneid_> Lyrch do you use tools to measure coverage too?
[21:26:17] <lyrch> i'm still pretty new to irc, so i lose context pretty fast
[21:26:19] <smirk__> well thats enough for me for now i dont wanna get anoying
[21:26:25] <red_sky> could you tell me what I said that prompted that response?
[21:26:31] <danopia> whoa, the linux cluster has eclipse
[21:26:34] <smirk__> thanks folks
[21:26:40] <lyrch> aschneid_, we have some, but the basic stuff that works in jenkins
[21:26:49] <red_sky> jenkins is pretty cool
[21:26:52] <red_sky> where is that hosted?
[21:26:58] <joholz> smirk_ we all bros here
[21:27:13] <aschneid_> Another good tool is to measure cyclomatic complexity
[21:27:34] <joholz> red_sky, anything for irc atm? or just installing eclipse?
[21:27:36] <lyrch> red_sky, when you asked about what i was talking about with "still important for adding features, fixing bugs"
[21:28:20] <red_sky> no, I meant what prompted you to say "still important for adding features, fixing bugs"
[21:28:29] <red_sky> I'm trying to see if there was a misunderstanding so I can try to clear it up
[21:28:45] <red_sky> joholz uhh... what are you referring to exactly?
[21:28:55] <smirk__> word im gonna eat dinne and watch married with children. so i gotta switch inputs from my wii. peace. im jeff btw.
[21:29:02] <lyrch> jaimeh, i'll see what i can do. i'm still a bit of an apprentice at my company right now in terms of tdd, but i've been graduated to journeyman apprentice and started to teach others
[21:29:04] <red_sky> nice to meet you jeff
[21:29:07] <red_sky> I'm Joe
[21:29:11] <red_sky> having a good evening
[21:29:27] <ThatPlayer> I'm jeff too :|
[21:29:39] <lyrch> red_sky, ah. it was "and the unit tests don't make it to the apk"
[21:30:13] <red_sky> ah, that's what I thought you were referring to.  What I meant by that is that the tests themselves aren't in the final code that gets packaged
[21:30:14] <smirk__> i am accept my legs hurt from a car breaking my bones
[21:30:38] <red_sky> damn cars
[21:30:41] <smirk__> heh
[21:30:43] <red_sky> they just hate us pedestrians
[21:30:48] <lyrch> red_sky, i may have missed some of the context to that, my client lagged and i suddenly was bombarded with messages
[21:31:02] <smirk__> sup jeff :D
[21:31:30] <lyrch> alright, later guys. this guy has a 4am wakeup
[21:31:32] <red_sky> <smirk__> the size of the app effects the way its runnning?
[21:31:32] <red_sky> <red_sky> app size isn't really an issue
[21:31:32] <red_sky> <red_sky> google increased the limits to 2GB for an apk, I think
[21:31:32] <red_sky> <lyrch> yup
[21:31:32] <red_sky> <red_sky> and the unit tests don't make it to the apk
[21:31:38] <smirk__> my accident was sooo f ing scary
[21:31:47] <red_sky> later lyrch

[21:36:00] ### aschneid__ has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[21:36:06] <red_sky> where's all the information about setting up mylyn and whatnot with eclipse?
[21:36:17] <wjoe> wow. sounds like a scary experience. break anything?
[21:36:21] <Sanit> need a bit of help with this app if anyone has a second
[21:36:25] <adamell> mylyn is already in eclipse
[21:36:28] <red_sky> yeah
[21:36:34] <red_sky> doesn't it need to connect to a server somewhere?
[21:36:38] <adamell> you mean the redmine connecter?
[21:36:44] <red_sky> sure
[21:37:01] <wjoe> we probably need a guide for this
[21:37:21] <wjoe> you need to install the plugin for one. I haven't tried it yet though
[21:37:36] <adamell> go: help>install new software
[21:38:02] <adamell> then put http://redmin-mylyncon.sourceforge.net/update-site/N/
[21:38:15] <smirk__> chipped bone in left knee and broke tibia and fibia completely on right ... had surgury. they put in a rod
[21:38:41] <red_sky> thanks
[21:38:48] <wjoe> ouch. how long does that take to heal?
[21:38:57] <red_sky> I swear there's a page on the redmine with all of the information about eclipse plugins to install
[21:39:01] <red_sky> but I can't seem to find it
[21:39:18] <adamell> http://sourceforge.net/apps/wordpress/redmin-mylyncon/
[21:39:20] <anjoyed_o0O> just add that update site adamell linked
[21:39:33] <anjoyed_o0O> install both thingies from there
[21:39:46] <adamell> ^ this, for the first link
[21:40:04] <adamell> Then just configure with your API key and whatnot
[21:40:16] <red_sky> thanks
[21:40:24] <red_sky> what about the git gui plugin?
[21:40:31] <anjoyed_o0O> in eclipse go window->show view->other
[21:40:41] <anjoyed_o0O> select mylyn and add repo
