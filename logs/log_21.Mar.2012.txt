[00:14:28] <red_sky> I'm setting up my other server
[00:14:37] <red_sky> so far everything's fantastic
[00:14:53] <red_sky> it's only $0.50 more than my current VPS
[00:15:00] <red_sky> so if it's good, I'll definitely make the switch
[00:22:00] ### RadLogii has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[00:22:01] <red_sky> well, right now, I'm hosting a rather important website on it
[00:22:04] <red_sky> technically for school
[00:22:07] <red_sky> but it's actually a business
[00:22:33] ### D__ has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[00:23:53] <red_sky> I'm not sure how long it will take to transfer everything over
[00:23:56] <red_sky> probably not too long.

[01:05:49] <blaise_> I also don't like how any of the reddit apps do the comment threads.
[01:06:11] <blaise_> There's a Touchpad app that has a very good comment implementation.  I was going to see about getting some screen shots of it.
[01:06:41] <blaise_> Or, I do like BaconReader's comment implementation on a phone.
[01:07:09] <anjoyed> haven't actually seen any of them
[01:07:18] <anjoyed> i usually just browse i.reddit
[01:08:46] <blaise_> It's been a long time since I've even logged into Slashdot.  I've been using it since it's early days, even have one of the lower membership numbers.  Should start checking it out.
[01:09:00] <blaise_> again.
[01:09:01] <anjoyed> if a lot of the projects need to use image storage/retrieval then might be wise to build an imgur component that they can add
[01:09:15] <anjoyed> rather than everyone implementing their own solution
[01:09:21] <blaise_> I was looking at the imgur api today
[01:09:26] <blaise_> Pretty straight forward.
[01:09:55] <blaise_> They do limit the number of calls per hour by IP (and if  you are anonymous or not).
[01:10:03] <blaise_> But the limits are pretty high.
[01:10:29] <anjoyed> something to keep in mind though
[01:10:44] <blaise_> It seems like several of the apps could potentially use it, so I was thinking it might be a good framework to write
[01:11:12] <blaise_> And the caps are by IP…so, if each persons phone is doing it, that would only apply to that user.
[01:12:10] <anjoyed> 50 uploads per hour for anonymous
[01:12:21] ### markerz| has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[01:12:37] <blaise_> Yeah…and that's actually quite a bit of pictures.
[01:12:50] <blaise_> If the user logged in, it's higher too.
[01:12:58] <red_sky> 50 per hour is pretty high
[01:13:02] <red_sky> so that's not bad
[01:13:08] <anjoyed> yep. if you use oauth you get twice that per imgur account
[01:13:14] <red_sky> that's one picture per 1 and 1/10 minutes
[01:13:40] <blaise_> I was think that picture hunt game could potentially use imgur for hosting.
[01:13:57] <red_sky> or is it 1/5...
[01:14:03] <anjoyed> yeah, thats the one I had in mind
[01:14:03] <blaise_> Still would need some sort of server to do the voting, etc, but that's not the bandwidth hogging part
[01:14:22] <blaise_> Or disk storage

[01:19:33] ### markerz- has quit the server. (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[01:19:41] <anjoyed> 500 credits per hour for anonymous use. every api call uses 1 credit, uploads use 10 credits
[01:20:02] <anjoyed> pretty decent
[01:20:14] <blaise_> Yeah….although you know I tried some calls today via my browser and it didn't count
[01:20:32] <blaise_> Not sure if they only count if you go against api.imgur.com or not
[01:20:54] <blaise_> but you can go to  www.imgur.com/gallery.json and it will give you the same thing
[01:21:19] <blaise_> You can also sub it and go to www.imgur.com/r/wtf.json or any of the reddit subs
[01:21:32] <anjoyed> i was thinking it would be handy to use one imgur account for an app and have all uploads go there
[01:21:33] <blaise_> That's the part I thought was cool.
[01:21:46] <anjoyed> but if many used the app you could well hit the credit limit
[01:21:51] <blaise_> Well, all pics are available for everybody.
[01:22:07] <blaise_> And if we wrote the framework to return the hash when you store it
[01:22:20] <blaise_> we could store that in a server side database and retrieve all the images
[01:22:33] <anjoyed> aye, would be handy
[01:22:58] <blaise_> That way each user could have either their oauth account or even anonymous if they uploaded less than 50 an hour.
[01:23:30] <blaise_> For retrieval, we could hit our server to get the hashes, and then have the client do the retrieve
[01:23:44] <blaise_> That way, again, it's against the client and not a bunch of hits from our server ip.

[01:34:00] <red_sky> apparently OpenJDK needs the preceding ./ whereas Sun JDK doesn't
[01:34:23] <red_sky> now the damn thing shouldn't time out all the time
[01:34:43] <anjoyed> good job
[01:35:19] <joholz> what were you working on?
[01:35:35] <red_sky> server migration
[01:36:07] <anjoyed> they moving south for the spring
[01:36:16] <red_sky> hopefully the new VPS won't have a shitty connection like my other one
[01:41:03] <joholz> what you think caused latency?
[01:44:17] <red_sky> my VPS
[01:44:21] <red_sky> or their service provider
[01:44:31] <red_sky> VPS provider* or service provider
[01:45:20] <red_sky> so I just realized that in the past 24 hours, I've only consumed some water, tea, a milkshake, 2 monster energy drinks, a clif bar, and some reese's pieces
[01:45:29] <red_sky> I need to find food.
[01:45:53] <joholz> haha wow, your going to be the end of yourself
[01:46:12] <red_sky> yeah, it's not intentional... I usually just get wrapped up in things and forget to eat
[01:46:42] <anjoyed> man, get some decent food into you
[01:46:55] <red_sky> all the "decent" food places are closed
[01:46:59] <red_sky> I'm out of food
[01:47:06] <red_sky> that leaves mcdonald's and taco bell
[01:47:26] <red_sky> both of which are disgusting
[01:47:27] <anjoyed> not good :<
[01:47:43] <joholz> quick stop at walmart
[01:48:00] <red_sky> hah, the nearest one is about 3 miles away
[01:48:02] <red_sky> I don't have a car
[01:48:17] <ThatPlayer> some grass
[01:48:21] <joholz> dirt
[01:48:29] <joholz> hunt
[01:48:40] <red_sky> lol
[01:48:55] <joholz> how do you live without a car?
[01:49:06] <joholz> bus?
[01:49:13] <red_sky> easy, 1) bike, 2) I'm a student
[01:49:13] <ThatPlayer> I live without a car, I'm a poor college student =)
[01:49:25] <red_sky> everything I usually do is within 2 miles
[01:49:37] <red_sky> though I don't like to go shopping with my bike as I lack panniers
[01:49:42] <ThatPlayer> I dorm so that's nice
[01:49:49] <ThatPlayer> But I'm getting a car next school year, commuting
[01:50:00] <joholz> also youd use a good amount of energy just to go ther i assume, 3 miles
[01:50:04] <red_sky> my shitty diet started ever since I got off my campus meal plan
[01:50:12] <red_sky> so I've gotten used to it
[01:50:16] <red_sky> it's been like a year, and was gradual
[01:50:37] <joholz> make a habit to put protein bars in your socks and pants
[01:50:46] <red_sky> haha
[01:51:15] <anjoyed> learn to cook. it's cheap, easy and tasty(ish)
[01:51:24] <red_sky> see, all of the good supermarkets are far away
[01:51:31] <red_sky> the ones in town are like twice the price
[01:51:50] <anjoyed> they don't have delivery?
[01:52:01] <red_sky> I've never heard of that, frankly
[01:52:09] <red_sky> except for that Amazon Fresh service or whatever
[01:52:29] <red_sky> okay,
[01:52:39] <red_sky> RadLogii is logging and syncing with Git
[01:52:43] <red_sky> so I did all that just fine
[01:52:51] <joholz> get a years supply of ramen
[01:53:03] <red_sky> everyone always suggests it
[01:53:07] <red_sky> it's what I basically lived on in the summer
[01:53:13] <red_sky> so I've grown to dislike it...
[01:53:16] <joholz> for the price its awesome
[01:53:19] <red_sky> yeah
[01:53:29] <red_sky> doesn't really have any nutritional value, though
[01:53:39] <joholz> have u tried other flavors?
[01:53:48] <joholz> yea i guess not, im not sure
[01:53:52] <red_sky> what do they make besides chicken, beef, and turkey?
[01:54:09] <joholz> well
[01:54:17] <joholz> you have 3 flavors there
[01:54:30] <red_sky> beef and turkey are inherently gross
[01:54:35] <joholz> if you mix them you can get up to 9 flavors
[01:54:37] <red_sky> chicken is the only one I liked
[01:54:42] <red_sky> I suppose that's true
[01:54:54] <red_sky> I'm going to try to find some food
[01:54:54] <aschneid> They have a shrimp flavor too, which I find quite disgusting
[01:54:55] <red_sky> I'll ttyl
[01:54:59] <joholz> thats a steady growth of 300%!
[01:55:01] <joholz> laters
[01:55:03] <joholz> take it easy
[01:55:20] <red_sky> you too.  I should be back in ~20
[01:55:22] <red_sky> minutes
[01:55:28] <joholz> ok
[01:55:45] <joholz> ill be waiting
[01:57:07] <joholz> im trying to get depeer into android dev, anyone have school reccomendations?
[01:57:52] <aschneid> If you  know Java, I'd say just read the developers guide, or check out some of the tutorial YouTube videos out there.
[01:58:03] <aschneid> Some of the links have been floating around here.
[01:58:30] <vcarl> hint for it: don't both with the syntax, learn the organization
[01:58:46] <vcarl> don't dive into the APIs and such, those are relatively easy, learn how apps are structure
[01:58:47] <vcarl> d
[01:59:17] <aschneid> Yeah, most of the books out there (and I believe the developer guide) initially start with intents, activities, etc
[01:59:28] <aschneid> Then delve into resources and how they are defined.
[01:59:40] ### Esge has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[01:59:46] <joholz> im thinking mainly about job, you think showing apps I make is enough?
[01:59:54] <aschneid> Yeah.
[01:59:56] <vcarl> for some
[02:00:08] <vcarl> depends where, of course
[02:00:18] <joholz> makes sense
[02:00:21] <aschneid> I don't think there are many schools that offer Android development officially.
[02:00:32] <vcarl> my community college offers a class
[02:00:35] <vcarl> but no degree or anything
[02:01:19] <aschneid> I mean, you have to get experience somewhere….and if you have a programming background and have put out a couple of apps (hopefully well received), most companies will take that to at least get the interview process going.
[02:01:54] <vcarl> yeah, having something in the market is huge
[02:01:54] <joholz> yea thats true
[02:02:09] <aschneid> I'm primarily a Java/JEE developer, but none of my applications have ever been internet facing.
[02:02:15] <vcarl> i have  a lot of little projects that are neat, but nothing that's actually in distribution
[02:02:19] <aschneid> So, I use the experience on my resume to get me in the door
[02:02:29] <aschneid> then ace the technical interview. :-)
[02:02:56] <joholz> how does one "ace the technical interview"?
[02:03:05] <vcarl> answer all their questions :P
[02:03:07] <anjoyed> know your shit
[02:03:11] <anjoyed> :)
[02:03:16] <aschneid> Depends on what they are asking.
[02:03:18] <joholz> haha nuff said
[02:03:28] <aschneid> I typically go in for Architect level positions now.
[02:03:43] <aschneid> So, the questions are different than a line level programmer
[02:04:18] <aschneid> But I would say, if we even get involved in the development here and *hopefully* get some apps out that you help work on
[02:04:26] <aschneid> That will be experience you can put on your resume
[02:04:46] <aschneid> Couple that with any individual learning you did (to ace the interview)
[02:04:55] <aschneid> That would get you in the door
[02:05:21] <aschneid> I've done hiring and interviewing in the past…I just want to see enough on your resume to make it sound like you know your stuff and have done the work
[02:05:41] <aschneid> I will weed out those who don't know what they are doing (or lying on their resume) in the interview
[02:05:44] ### Dillon[ca] has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[02:06:03] <joholz> well if they expect what I write on my resume i shoudln't have a problem
[02:07:08] <aschneid> Almost every interview I have been on (and that's probably about 30-40 in the last 15 years…) always covers what you have on your resume
[02:07:26] <aschneid> Then they will almost always go beyond your comfort zone to see where your limits are
[02:09:12] <aschneid> The problem is finding a company that will pay you to do Android development. :-)
[02:09:13] ### alextsc has joined ##reddit-android-developers

[02:10:05] <anjoyed> guten morgen
[02:10:09] <aschneid> Yeah…I've been working for a little over 15 years.  Mostly consulting/contracting work

[02:13:32] <joholz> red_sky is back?
[02:13:35] <red_sky> joholz the most important part of learning Android development is the organizational flow of the app.  It's radically different than anything I've done on PC in the bast
[02:13:35] <vcarl> i'm MI
[02:13:37] <red_sky> past*
[02:14:15] ### RAWR has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[02:14:45] <joholz> red_sky: are you talking about app states and how the stack is influenced?
[02:15:10] <aschneid> I think he's talking about how events get triggered etc.
[02:15:12] <red_sky> I'm talking about things like Intents, Views, etc.
[02:15:23] <red_sky> Activities
[02:15:36] <red_sky> the stuff that's really integral to Android development
[02:15:36] <joholz> services, etc. got it
[02:15:39] <red_sky> it's not hard to figure it out
[02:15:41] <aschneid> It's actually similar to how some of the newer GUI environments work.
[02:15:49] <red_sky> but if you dive in without understanding, you'll make a shitty app
[02:15:52] <aschneid> C# has WPF that's actually similar
[02:15:58] <red_sky> WPF is fun
[02:16:05] <red_sky> though nothing for intents or activities
[02:16:09] <red_sky> those are really different
[02:16:43] <joholz> oh yea, ive played with mono for android
[02:17:05] <vcarl> anyone ever fiddle with Qt?
[02:17:07] <aschneid> Well…depends on how you look at it.
[02:17:18] <vcarl> I love the way it's organized, it fits my brain
[02:17:19] <red_sky> i have vcarl
[02:17:28] <red_sky> very briefly
[02:17:34] <aschneid> When I was first looking at it, it definitely reminded me of my WPF days.
[02:17:54] <red_sky> I used Qt to host the window I made for an OpenCV project I made
[02:17:57] <vcarl> signals and slots! it's all interrupts :)
[02:18:10] <aschneid> It also reminds me of some of the web toolkits out there.

[02:31:02] <red_sky> my house doesn't have internet... so
[02:31:07] <red_sky> my apartment, however, does
[02:31:43] <joholz> geez, those are blazing speeds
[02:31:45] <danopia> this is insane
[02:31:55] <danopia> as soon as i start the test, it starts at like 90Mb
[02:31:57] <red_sky> I love how America has like the 50th slowest internet in the world
[02:32:05] <red_sky> and we invented it, basically
[02:32:09] <danopia> then it jumps to 400-500Mb/s and completes the test instantly

[02:33:44] ### vcarl has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[02:34:08] <vcarl> to be fair, south korea has like 8 people
[02:34:15] <joholz> red_sky its simple, the more were limited, the more they can charge
[02:34:27] <vcarl> our infrastructure also sucks
[02:34:58] <vcarl> we need a repeat of the 60s highway construction, but with network cables
[02:35:03] <danopia> first to market == older infra
[02:35:05] <red_sky> south korea has a higher population than Canada
[02:35:09] <red_sky> 48,875,000 or so
[02:35:19] <red_sky> and our infrastructure is almost entirely fiber
[02:35:25] <red_sky> so I highly doubt that's it
[02:35:35] <joholz> greed i tell you
[02:35:45] <danopia> the good part of it, yes
[02:35:49] <vcarl> is it almost entirely fiber?
[02:35:58] <danopia> not the part to consumers, except FiOS
[02:36:07] <red_sky> all of the backbone is 100% fiber
[02:36:08] <vcarl> yeah, that's what i thought
[02:36:16] <red_sky> and then fiber connects all the substations, or whatever
[02:36:20] <vcarl> the distribution cables are still limited though
[02:36:20] <danopia> our ADSL line is lowquality
[02:36:23] <red_sky> and then from there it's cable
[02:36:25] <danopia> it gets bad signal
[02:36:42] <red_sky> I've had that issue in the past.  It's like a satellite dish... randomly goes off and on
[02:36:45] <danopia> sometimes the modem negotiates a speed that equates to about 3 KBytes/second
[02:36:50] ### Airheebz has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[02:36:58] <danopia> because it negotations while the line has noise
[02:37:08] <danopia> (no exagoration, either)
[02:37:21] <vcarl> a fair amount of prices are because of regional monopolies, but some of it is shitty infrastructure
[02:37:36] <danopia> well yea, also monopoly of multiple companies
[02:37:40] <danopia> like mobile phone service
[02:37:47] <danopia> i forget the fancy name
[02:37:54] <danopia> multipoly?
[02:37:54] <red_sky> geographic monopolies are the worst
[02:37:55] <danopia> w/e
[02:37:59] <vcarl> oligopoly
[02:38:06] <red_sky> yeah, vcarl got it
[02:38:08] <vcarl> just took business last semester :P
[02:38:17] <red_sky> there's also probably certainly some collusion going on
[02:38:26] <red_sky> even though that's illegal, it's hard to prove.
[02:38:43] <vcarl> mhm
[02:38:58] <red_sky> romania has faster internet than the US, wtf.
[02:39:15] <vcarl> comcast "limits" my internet to 250gb/month, a soft cap
[02:39:22] <red_sky> yeah
[02:39:25] <red_sky> that's a new thing
[02:39:31] <red_sky> I hate it
[02:39:32] <vcarl> that's great for a single person, or 2-4, but with  we go 100gb over every month
[02:39:38] <vcarl> they haven't done anything yet though
[02:39:39] <red_sky> yeah, exactly
[02:39:41] <vcarl> *with 7
[02:39:49] <red_sky> if you go over it like... 3 months in a row, you'll get an email
[02:39:59] <red_sky> telling you they'll terminate your service if it continues
[02:40:01] <vcarl> heh, we're at 6, i've checked :P
[02:40:57] <red_sky> I'm surprised they haven't done anything yet
[02:41:01] <TheNumb> Hello (:
[02:41:04] <vcarl> me too
[02:41:06] <vcarl> hellooo
[02:41:12] <alextsc> hey
[02:41:19] <Airheebz> i got one of those letters after i downladed about 800Gb of data one month
[02:41:20] <vcarl> i have a friend who used 1.2tb in a month, then 500, then 700
[02:41:21] <TheNumb> Do we have a splash image for our apps?
[02:41:36] <vcarl> he got a personal phone call
[02:41:52] <TheNumb> vcarl: 1.2 TB?!
[02:41:57] <vcarl> yes.
[02:42:02] <red_sky> that's a large amountt
[02:42:03] <vcarl> constantly torrenting EVERYTHING
[02:42:07] <Airheebz> i just got a letter that said if i use over 200Gb again they will terminate account
[02:42:11] <red_sky> if it was all legal, that's very impressive
[02:42:11] <vcarl> he has like 12tb filled on his HTPC
[02:42:28] <vcarl> Airheebz, that sucks
[02:42:41] <red_sky> I got warned for torrenting
[02:42:42] <red_sky> like 3 times
[02:42:44] <Airheebz> meh, just have to watch what i download
[02:42:44] <vcarl> TheNumb, i don't know, but we have that logo vote that's wrapping up soon
[02:42:46] <red_sky> because my roommates liked to torrent
[02:42:53] <TheNumb> vcarl: I know, I know :P
[02:43:08] <Airheebz> sucks during steam sales :D
[02:43:12] <vcarl> hahaha
[02:43:40] <red_sky> penn state dorm users have a limit of 10GB // week
[02:43:44] <red_sky> I went over it all the time
[02:43:57] <red_sky> after you go over, they reduce speeds to 56k for the rest of the week
[02:44:04] <vcarl> ewww
[02:44:06] <TheNumb> red_sky: ummm, that sucks.
[02:44:08] <red_sky> and multiple infractions result in losing internet in your dorm
[02:44:13] <red_sky> it was super fast internet, too
[02:44:16] <vcarl> at mich tech, i got a DMCA violation once
[02:44:18] <TheNumb> red_sky: well, that's what my mobile carrier does.
[02:44:20] <red_sky> apparently it was 3GB / week like 3 years ago
[02:44:22] <TheNumb> >.>
[02:44:25] <vcarl> had to pay $100 and take a copyright law test
[02:44:32] <red_sky> wow, that sucks
[02:44:46] <red_sky> a student got escorted out of class here a few years back by federal agents
[02:44:48] <vcarl> for a bad copy of the movie that was in russian too, totally not worth it
[02:44:50] <red_sky> for piracy
[02:44:50] <vcarl> O_o
[02:45:41] <TheNumb> >.>
[02:46:03] <TheNumb> Apparently nobody gives a shit about piracy in Poland ;D
[02:46:35] <vcarl> lucky bastard :P
[02:46:50] <TheNumb> There are lots of people torrenting in student houses :P
[02:47:11] <TheNumb> No data cap, 1 Gbps speed :D
[02:49:10] <red_sky> oooo, that's nice
[02:49:11] <red_sky> new VPS
[02:49:18] <red_sky> running nginx and a java program
[02:49:29] <red_sky> 1.2GB free RAM (out of 2GB), and like 98% idle CPU
[02:49:50] <vcarl> nice
[02:49:58] <vcarl> i sort of understand what that means
[02:50:05] <TheNumb> red_sky: Unused RAM if wasted RAM :D
[02:50:10] <TheNumb> is*
[02:50:16] <red_sky> yeah, well it's better than my other vps
[02:50:23] <red_sky> where 90% of 512MB was in use
[02:50:27] <red_sky> and there wasn't much going on
[02:57:15] <anjoyed> RadLogii will be happy
