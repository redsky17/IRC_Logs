[00:14:28] <red_sky> I'm setting up my other server
[00:14:37] <red_sky> so far everything's fantastic
[00:14:53] <red_sky> it's only $0.50 more than my current VPS
[00:15:00] <red_sky> so if it's good, I'll definitely make the switch
[00:22:00] ### RadLogii has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[00:22:01] <red_sky> well, right now, I'm hosting a rather important website on it
[00:22:04] <red_sky> technically for school
[00:22:07] <red_sky> but it's actually a business
[00:22:33] ### D__ has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[00:23:53] <red_sky> I'm not sure how long it will take to transfer everything over
[00:23:56] <red_sky> probably not too long.

[01:05:49] <blaise_> I also don't like how any of the reddit apps do the comment threads.
[01:06:11] <blaise_> There's a Touchpad app that has a very good comment implementation.  I was going to see about getting some screen shots of it.
[01:06:41] <blaise_> Or, I do like BaconReader's comment implementation on a phone.
[01:07:09] <anjoyed> haven't actually seen any of them
[01:07:18] <anjoyed> i usually just browse i.reddit
[01:08:46] <blaise_> It's been a long time since I've even logged into Slashdot.  I've been using it since it's early days, even have one of the lower membership numbers.  Should start checking it out.
[01:09:00] <blaise_> again.
[01:09:01] <anjoyed> if a lot of the projects need to use image storage/retrieval then might be wise to build an imgur component that they can add
[01:09:15] <anjoyed> rather than everyone implementing their own solution
[01:09:21] <blaise_> I was looking at the imgur api today
[01:09:26] <blaise_> Pretty straight forward.
[01:09:55] <blaise_> They do limit the number of calls per hour by IP (and if  you are anonymous or not).
[01:10:03] <blaise_> But the limits are pretty high.
[01:10:29] <anjoyed> something to keep in mind though
[01:10:44] <blaise_> It seems like several of the apps could potentially use it, so I was thinking it might be a good framework to write
[01:11:12] <blaise_> And the caps are by IP…so, if each persons phone is doing it, that would only apply to that user.
[01:12:10] <anjoyed> 50 uploads per hour for anonymous
[01:12:21] ### markerz| has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[01:12:37] <blaise_> Yeah…and that's actually quite a bit of pictures.
[01:12:50] <blaise_> If the user logged in, it's higher too.
[01:12:58] <red_sky> 50 per hour is pretty high
[01:13:02] <red_sky> so that's not bad
[01:13:08] <anjoyed> yep. if you use oauth you get twice that per imgur account
[01:13:14] <red_sky> that's one picture per 1 and 1/10 minutes
[01:13:40] <blaise_> I was think that picture hunt game could potentially use imgur for hosting.
[01:13:57] <red_sky> or is it 1/5...
[01:14:03] <anjoyed> yeah, thats the one I had in mind
[01:14:03] <blaise_> Still would need some sort of server to do the voting, etc, but that's not the bandwidth hogging part
[01:14:22] <blaise_> Or disk storage

[01:19:33] ### markerz- has quit the server. (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[01:19:41] <anjoyed> 500 credits per hour for anonymous use. every api call uses 1 credit, uploads use 10 credits
[01:20:02] <anjoyed> pretty decent
[01:20:14] <blaise_> Yeah….although you know I tried some calls today via my browser and it didn't count
[01:20:32] <blaise_> Not sure if they only count if you go against api.imgur.com or not
[01:20:54] <blaise_> but you can go to  www.imgur.com/gallery.json and it will give you the same thing
[01:21:19] <blaise_> You can also sub it and go to www.imgur.com/r/wtf.json or any of the reddit subs
[01:21:32] <anjoyed> i was thinking it would be handy to use one imgur account for an app and have all uploads go there
[01:21:33] <blaise_> That's the part I thought was cool.
[01:21:46] <anjoyed> but if many used the app you could well hit the credit limit
[01:21:51] <blaise_> Well, all pics are available for everybody.
[01:22:07] <blaise_> And if we wrote the framework to return the hash when you store it
[01:22:20] <blaise_> we could store that in a server side database and retrieve all the images
[01:22:33] <anjoyed> aye, would be handy
[01:22:58] <blaise_> That way each user could have either their oauth account or even anonymous if they uploaded less than 50 an hour.
[01:23:30] <blaise_> For retrieval, we could hit our server to get the hashes, and then have the client do the retrieve
[01:23:44] <blaise_> That way, again, it's against the client and not a bunch of hits from our server ip.

[01:34:00] <red_sky> apparently OpenJDK needs the preceding ./ whereas Sun JDK doesn't
[01:34:23] <red_sky> now the damn thing shouldn't time out all the time
[01:34:43] <anjoyed> good job
[01:35:19] <joholz> what were you working on?
[01:35:35] <red_sky> server migration
[01:36:07] <anjoyed> they moving south for the spring
[01:36:16] <red_sky> hopefully the new VPS won't have a shitty connection like my other one
[01:41:03] <joholz> what you think caused latency?
[01:44:17] <red_sky> my VPS
[01:44:21] <red_sky> or their service provider
[01:44:31] <red_sky> VPS provider* or service provider
[01:45:20] <red_sky> so I just realized that in the past 24 hours, I've only consumed some water, tea, a milkshake, 2 monster energy drinks, a clif bar, and some reese's pieces
[01:45:29] <red_sky> I need to find food.
[01:45:53] <joholz> haha wow, your going to be the end of yourself
[01:46:12] <red_sky> yeah, it's not intentional... I usually just get wrapped up in things and forget to eat
[01:46:42] <anjoyed> man, get some decent food into you
[01:46:55] <red_sky> all the "decent" food places are closed
[01:46:59] <red_sky> I'm out of food
[01:47:06] <red_sky> that leaves mcdonald's and taco bell
[01:47:26] <red_sky> both of which are disgusting
[01:47:27] <anjoyed> not good :<
[01:47:43] <joholz> quick stop at walmart
[01:48:00] <red_sky> hah, the nearest one is about 3 miles away
[01:48:02] <red_sky> I don't have a car
[01:48:17] <ThatPlayer> some grass
[01:48:21] <joholz> dirt
[01:48:29] <joholz> hunt
[01:48:40] <red_sky> lol
[01:48:55] <joholz> how do you live without a car?
[01:49:06] <joholz> bus?
[01:49:13] <red_sky> easy, 1) bike, 2) I'm a student
[01:49:13] <ThatPlayer> I live without a car, I'm a poor college student =)
[01:49:25] <red_sky> everything I usually do is within 2 miles
[01:49:37] <red_sky> though I don't like to go shopping with my bike as I lack panniers
[01:49:42] <ThatPlayer> I dorm so that's nice
[01:49:49] <ThatPlayer> But I'm getting a car next school year, commuting
[01:50:00] <joholz> also youd use a good amount of energy just to go ther i assume, 3 miles
[01:50:04] <red_sky> my shitty diet started ever since I got off my campus meal plan
[01:50:12] <red_sky> so I've gotten used to it
[01:50:16] <red_sky> it's been like a year, and was gradual
[01:50:37] <joholz> make a habit to put protein bars in your socks and pants
[01:50:46] <red_sky> haha
[01:51:15] <anjoyed> learn to cook. it's cheap, easy and tasty(ish)
[01:51:24] <red_sky> see, all of the good supermarkets are far away
[01:51:31] <red_sky> the ones in town are like twice the price
[01:51:50] <anjoyed> they don't have delivery?
[01:52:01] <red_sky> I've never heard of that, frankly
[01:52:09] <red_sky> except for that Amazon Fresh service or whatever
[01:52:29] <red_sky> okay,
[01:52:39] <red_sky> RadLogii is logging and syncing with Git
[01:52:43] <red_sky> so I did all that just fine
[01:52:51] <joholz> get a years supply of ramen
[01:53:03] <red_sky> everyone always suggests it
[01:53:07] <red_sky> it's what I basically lived on in the summer
[01:53:13] <red_sky> so I've grown to dislike it...
[01:53:16] <joholz> for the price its awesome
[01:53:19] <red_sky> yeah
[01:53:29] <red_sky> doesn't really have any nutritional value, though
[01:53:39] <joholz> have u tried other flavors?
[01:53:48] <joholz> yea i guess not, im not sure
[01:53:52] <red_sky> what do they make besides chicken, beef, and turkey?
[01:54:09] <joholz> well
[01:54:17] <joholz> you have 3 flavors there
[01:54:30] <red_sky> beef and turkey are inherently gross
[01:54:35] <joholz> if you mix them you can get up to 9 flavors
[01:54:37] <red_sky> chicken is the only one I liked
[01:54:42] <red_sky> I suppose that's true
[01:54:54] <red_sky> I'm going to try to find some food
[01:54:54] <aschneid> They have a shrimp flavor too, which I find quite disgusting
[01:54:55] <red_sky> I'll ttyl
[01:54:59] <joholz> thats a steady growth of 300%!
[01:55:01] <joholz> laters
[01:55:03] <joholz> take it easy
[01:55:20] <red_sky> you too.  I should be back in ~20
[01:55:22] <red_sky> minutes
[01:55:28] <joholz> ok
[01:55:45] <joholz> ill be waiting
[01:57:07] <joholz> im trying to get depeer into android dev, anyone have school reccomendations?
[01:57:52] <aschneid> If you  know Java, I'd say just read the developers guide, or check out some of the tutorial YouTube videos out there.
[01:58:03] <aschneid> Some of the links have been floating around here.
[01:58:30] <vcarl> hint for it: don't both with the syntax, learn the organization
[01:58:46] <vcarl> don't dive into the APIs and such, those are relatively easy, learn how apps are structure
[01:58:47] <vcarl> d
[01:59:17] <aschneid> Yeah, most of the books out there (and I believe the developer guide) initially start with intents, activities, etc
[01:59:28] <aschneid> Then delve into resources and how they are defined.
[01:59:40] ### Esge has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[01:59:46] <joholz> im thinking mainly about job, you think showing apps I make is enough?
[01:59:54] <aschneid> Yeah.
[01:59:56] <vcarl> for some
[02:00:08] <vcarl> depends where, of course
[02:00:18] <joholz> makes sense
[02:00:21] <aschneid> I don't think there are many schools that offer Android development officially.
[02:00:32] <vcarl> my community college offers a class
[02:00:35] <vcarl> but no degree or anything
[02:01:19] <aschneid> I mean, you have to get experience somewhere….and if you have a programming background and have put out a couple of apps (hopefully well received), most companies will take that to at least get the interview process going.
[02:01:54] <vcarl> yeah, having something in the market is huge
[02:01:54] <joholz> yea thats true
[02:02:09] <aschneid> I'm primarily a Java/JEE developer, but none of my applications have ever been internet facing.
[02:02:15] <vcarl> i have  a lot of little projects that are neat, but nothing that's actually in distribution
[02:02:19] <aschneid> So, I use the experience on my resume to get me in the door
[02:02:29] <aschneid> then ace the technical interview. :-)
[02:02:56] <joholz> how does one "ace the technical interview"?
[02:03:05] <vcarl> answer all their questions :P
[02:03:07] <anjoyed> know your shit
[02:03:11] <anjoyed> :)
[02:03:16] <aschneid> Depends on what they are asking.
[02:03:18] <joholz> haha nuff said
[02:03:28] <aschneid> I typically go in for Architect level positions now.
[02:03:43] <aschneid> So, the questions are different than a line level programmer
[02:04:18] <aschneid> But I would say, if we even get involved in the development here and *hopefully* get some apps out that you help work on
[02:04:26] <aschneid> That will be experience you can put on your resume
[02:04:46] <aschneid> Couple that with any individual learning you did (to ace the interview)
[02:04:55] <aschneid> That would get you in the door
[02:05:21] <aschneid> I've done hiring and interviewing in the past…I just want to see enough on your resume to make it sound like you know your stuff and have done the work
[02:05:41] <aschneid> I will weed out those who don't know what they are doing (or lying on their resume) in the interview
[02:05:44] ### Dillon[ca] has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[02:06:03] <joholz> well if they expect what I write on my resume i shoudln't have a problem
[02:07:08] <aschneid> Almost every interview I have been on (and that's probably about 30-40 in the last 15 years…) always covers what you have on your resume
[02:07:26] <aschneid> Then they will almost always go beyond your comfort zone to see where your limits are
[02:09:12] <aschneid> The problem is finding a company that will pay you to do Android development. :-)
[02:09:13] ### alextsc has joined ##reddit-android-developers

[02:10:05] <anjoyed> guten morgen
[02:10:09] <aschneid> Yeah…I've been working for a little over 15 years.  Mostly consulting/contracting work

[02:13:32] <joholz> red_sky is back?
[02:13:35] <red_sky> joholz the most important part of learning Android development is the organizational flow of the app.  It's radically different than anything I've done on PC in the bast
[02:13:35] <vcarl> i'm MI
[02:13:37] <red_sky> past*
[02:14:15] ### RAWR has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[02:14:45] <joholz> red_sky: are you talking about app states and how the stack is influenced?
[02:15:10] <aschneid> I think he's talking about how events get triggered etc.
[02:15:12] <red_sky> I'm talking about things like Intents, Views, etc.
[02:15:23] <red_sky> Activities
[02:15:36] <red_sky> the stuff that's really integral to Android development
[02:15:36] <joholz> services, etc. got it
[02:15:39] <red_sky> it's not hard to figure it out
[02:15:41] <aschneid> It's actually similar to how some of the newer GUI environments work.
[02:15:49] <red_sky> but if you dive in without understanding, you'll make a shitty app
[02:15:52] <aschneid> C# has WPF that's actually similar
[02:15:58] <red_sky> WPF is fun
[02:16:05] <red_sky> though nothing for intents or activities
[02:16:09] <red_sky> those are really different
[02:16:43] <joholz> oh yea, ive played with mono for android
[02:17:05] <vcarl> anyone ever fiddle with Qt?
[02:17:07] <aschneid> Well…depends on how you look at it.
[02:17:18] <vcarl> I love the way it's organized, it fits my brain
[02:17:19] <red_sky> i have vcarl
[02:17:28] <red_sky> very briefly
[02:17:34] <aschneid> When I was first looking at it, it definitely reminded me of my WPF days.
[02:17:54] <red_sky> I used Qt to host the window I made for an OpenCV project I made
[02:17:57] <vcarl> signals and slots! it's all interrupts :)
[02:18:10] <aschneid> It also reminds me of some of the web toolkits out there.

[02:31:02] <red_sky> my house doesn't have internet... so
[02:31:07] <red_sky> my apartment, however, does
[02:31:43] <joholz> geez, those are blazing speeds
[02:31:45] <danopia> this is insane
[02:31:55] <danopia> as soon as i start the test, it starts at like 90Mb
[02:31:57] <red_sky> I love how America has like the 50th slowest internet in the world
[02:32:05] <red_sky> and we invented it, basically
[02:32:09] <danopia> then it jumps to 400-500Mb/s and completes the test instantly

[02:33:44] ### vcarl has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[02:34:08] <vcarl> to be fair, south korea has like 8 people
[02:34:15] <joholz> red_sky its simple, the more were limited, the more they can charge
[02:34:27] <vcarl> our infrastructure also sucks
[02:34:58] <vcarl> we need a repeat of the 60s highway construction, but with network cables
[02:35:03] <danopia> first to market == older infra
[02:35:05] <red_sky> south korea has a higher population than Canada
[02:35:09] <red_sky> 48,875,000 or so
[02:35:19] <red_sky> and our infrastructure is almost entirely fiber
[02:35:25] <red_sky> so I highly doubt that's it
[02:35:35] <joholz> greed i tell you
[02:35:45] <danopia> the good part of it, yes
[02:35:49] <vcarl> is it almost entirely fiber?
[02:35:58] <danopia> not the part to consumers, except FiOS
[02:36:07] <red_sky> all of the backbone is 100% fiber
[02:36:08] <vcarl> yeah, that's what i thought
[02:36:16] <red_sky> and then fiber connects all the substations, or whatever
[02:36:20] <vcarl> the distribution cables are still limited though
[02:36:20] <danopia> our ADSL line is lowquality
[02:36:23] <red_sky> and then from there it's cable
[02:36:25] <danopia> it gets bad signal
[02:36:42] <red_sky> I've had that issue in the past.  It's like a satellite dish... randomly goes off and on
[02:36:45] <danopia> sometimes the modem negotiates a speed that equates to about 3 KBytes/second
[02:36:50] ### Airheebz has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[02:36:58] <danopia> because it negotations while the line has noise
[02:37:08] <danopia> (no exagoration, either)
[02:37:21] <vcarl> a fair amount of prices are because of regional monopolies, but some of it is shitty infrastructure
[02:37:36] <danopia> well yea, also monopoly of multiple companies
[02:37:40] <danopia> like mobile phone service
[02:37:47] <danopia> i forget the fancy name
[02:37:54] <danopia> multipoly?
[02:37:54] <red_sky> geographic monopolies are the worst
[02:37:55] <danopia> w/e
[02:37:59] <vcarl> oligopoly
[02:38:06] <red_sky> yeah, vcarl got it
[02:38:08] <vcarl> just took business last semester :P
[02:38:17] <red_sky> there's also probably certainly some collusion going on
[02:38:26] <red_sky> even though that's illegal, it's hard to prove.
[02:38:43] <vcarl> mhm
[02:38:58] <red_sky> romania has faster internet than the US, wtf.
[02:39:15] <vcarl> comcast "limits" my internet to 250gb/month, a soft cap
[02:39:22] <red_sky> yeah
[02:39:25] <red_sky> that's a new thing
[02:39:31] <red_sky> I hate it
[02:39:32] <vcarl> that's great for a single person, or 2-4, but with  we go 100gb over every month
[02:39:38] <vcarl> they haven't done anything yet though
[02:39:39] <red_sky> yeah, exactly
[02:39:41] <vcarl> *with 7
[02:39:49] <red_sky> if you go over it like... 3 months in a row, you'll get an email
[02:39:59] <red_sky> telling you they'll terminate your service if it continues
[02:40:01] <vcarl> heh, we're at 6, i've checked :P
[02:40:57] <red_sky> I'm surprised they haven't done anything yet
[02:41:01] <TheNumb> Hello (:
[02:41:04] <vcarl> me too
[02:41:06] <vcarl> hellooo
[02:41:12] <alextsc> hey
[02:41:19] <Airheebz> i got one of those letters after i downladed about 800Gb of data one month
[02:41:20] <vcarl> i have a friend who used 1.2tb in a month, then 500, then 700
[02:41:21] <TheNumb> Do we have a splash image for our apps?
[02:41:36] <vcarl> he got a personal phone call
[02:41:52] <TheNumb> vcarl: 1.2 TB?!
[02:41:57] <vcarl> yes.
[02:42:02] <red_sky> that's a large amountt
[02:42:03] <vcarl> constantly torrenting EVERYTHING
[02:42:07] <Airheebz> i just got a letter that said if i use over 200Gb again they will terminate account
[02:42:11] <red_sky> if it was all legal, that's very impressive
[02:42:11] <vcarl> he has like 12tb filled on his HTPC
[02:42:28] <vcarl> Airheebz, that sucks
[02:42:41] <red_sky> I got warned for torrenting
[02:42:42] <red_sky> like 3 times
[02:42:44] <Airheebz> meh, just have to watch what i download
[02:42:44] <vcarl> TheNumb, i don't know, but we have that logo vote that's wrapping up soon
[02:42:46] <red_sky> because my roommates liked to torrent
[02:42:53] <TheNumb> vcarl: I know, I know :P
[02:43:08] <Airheebz> sucks during steam sales :D
[02:43:12] <vcarl> hahaha
[02:43:40] <red_sky> penn state dorm users have a limit of 10GB // week
[02:43:44] <red_sky> I went over it all the time
[02:43:57] <red_sky> after you go over, they reduce speeds to 56k for the rest of the week
[02:44:04] <vcarl> ewww
[02:44:06] <TheNumb> red_sky: ummm, that sucks.
[02:44:08] <red_sky> and multiple infractions result in losing internet in your dorm
[02:44:13] <red_sky> it was super fast internet, too
[02:44:16] <vcarl> at mich tech, i got a DMCA violation once
[02:44:18] <TheNumb> red_sky: well, that's what my mobile carrier does.
[02:44:20] <red_sky> apparently it was 3GB / week like 3 years ago
[02:44:22] <TheNumb> >.>
[02:44:25] <vcarl> had to pay $100 and take a copyright law test
[02:44:32] <red_sky> wow, that sucks
[02:44:46] <red_sky> a student got escorted out of class here a few years back by federal agents
[02:44:48] <vcarl> for a bad copy of the movie that was in russian too, totally not worth it
[02:44:50] <red_sky> for piracy
[02:44:50] <vcarl> O_o
[02:45:41] <TheNumb> >.>
[02:46:03] <TheNumb> Apparently nobody gives a shit about piracy in Poland ;D
[02:46:35] <vcarl> lucky bastard :P
[02:46:50] <TheNumb> There are lots of people torrenting in student houses :P
[02:47:11] <TheNumb> No data cap, 1 Gbps speed :D
[02:49:10] <red_sky> oooo, that's nice
[02:49:11] <red_sky> new VPS
[02:49:18] <red_sky> running nginx and a java program
[02:49:29] <red_sky> 1.2GB free RAM (out of 2GB), and like 98% idle CPU
[02:49:50] <vcarl> nice
[02:49:58] <vcarl> i sort of understand what that means
[02:50:05] <TheNumb> red_sky: Unused RAM if wasted RAM :D
[02:50:10] <TheNumb> is*
[02:50:16] <red_sky> yeah, well it's better than my other vps
[02:50:23] <red_sky> where 90% of 512MB was in use
[02:50:27] <red_sky> and there wasn't much going on
[02:57:15] <anjoyed> RadLogii will be happy
[02:57:16] <red_sky> well, night all
[02:57:21] <anjoyed> nn
[02:57:43] <vcarl> 'night

[03:44:01] <Hogofwar> hey member68
[03:44:51] <member68> morning :)
[03:45:08] <ThatPlayer> Morning
[03:46:43] <member68> anything happen in the last 8 hours? btw, we need a better system tracking decisions and progress
[03:46:50] <member68> *system for tracking
[03:47:51] <joholz> no nothing much, just new polls
[03:47:51] <TheNumb> member68: HAI
[03:48:05] <aschneid> I had a conversation about potentially writing an imgur framework (and maybe an app) after looking through some of the potential app idea.
[03:48:14] <aschneid> (when my nick was blaise_)
[03:48:19] <Hogofwar> !logs
[03:48:34] <TheNumb> aschneid: we could use imgur API.
[03:48:53] <TheNumb> It's fairly simple.
[03:48:54] <aschneid> However, I'm not sure the chat log picked everything up because the bot was up and down
[03:49:01] <aschneid> Yeah….that was part of the discussion
[03:49:34] <Hogofwar> aschneid, it was?
[03:49:39] <aschneid> I have the log saved here locally
[03:49:53] <member68> good idea, especially since it's related to Reddit.
[03:49:56] <aschneid> Hogofwar: the imgur api was discussed
[03:50:11] <joholz> the bot should be good now, I think i remember him saying he did some work
[03:50:12] <Hogofwar> aschneid, I mean the bot going up and down
[03:50:24] <member68> care to send me the log? i'll read it for breakfast
[03:50:28] <aschneid> Yeah….I tied it into discussion of the Reddit apps and the picture hunt apps (have an idea for it.
[03:50:41] <danopia> member68, log of this chan?
[03:50:45] <danopia> i've been logging since i joined
[03:50:52] <aschneid> Hogofwar: It was a problem with red_sky's vps
[03:50:57] <Hogofwar> K
[03:51:09] <aschneid> He switched and it's been up since
[03:51:27] <aschneid> Of course, it was bouncing up and down while we were talking about the imgur framework. :-)
[03:51:47] <danopia> i can scp my log up to the cluster but it's very extensive
[03:51:50] <aschneid> member68: you want it here, or somewhere else?
[03:51:53] <anjoyed> think most of it was logged
[03:52:12] <member68> don't care. whatever works
[03:52:20] <danopia> http://cs.drexel.edu/~djl75/FreeNode-%23%23reddit-android-developers.log
[03:52:26] <danopia> is everything
[03:52:48] <danopia> in case anyone wants it...
[03:52:50] <member68> danopia: what timezone is that?
[03:52:56] <danopia> EST
[03:53:03] <danopia> i have no idea when it was first started
[03:53:19] <danopia> but it's 443KB of IRC
[03:54:03] <member68> you're up at 4AM? not bad
[03:54:06] <danopia> i lied
[03:54:15] <danopia> that excludes the entire time i'm on linux
[03:54:18] <danopia> windows*
[03:54:21] ### vcarl has quit the server. (Ping timeout: 246 seconds)
[03:54:24] <danopia> which was 15 horus
[03:54:30] <aschneid> The conversation starts at 00:58:48 in danopia's log
[03:54:51] <danopia> thank you for ctrl-f-friendly
[03:55:50] <aschneid> Goes to 01:25:39
[03:55:54] <danopia> i'm going to set up a loop to scp the latest log up every 30 minutes
[03:56:13] <aschneid> Basically between anjoyed and myself (blaise_ at the time)
[03:56:18] <danopia> done, i ahve to sleep now
[03:57:45] <danopia> heck, i could mount the cluster's nfs locally and tell xchat to log line-by-line into that....
[03:57:49] <danopia> but too mcuh effort :P
[03:58:06] ### Fault has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[03:58:49] <aschneid> I'm using Colloquy on a Mac and just realized all the logs are in XML…makes it a pain to send to anybody.  Glad you had your logs available danopia.
[03:58:54] <member68> go to bed, danopia. you deserve it
[03:59:21] <danopia> member68, but i didn't do any work on RAD today :(
[03:59:28] <danopia> i did get an IRL job of sorts though
[03:59:36] <danopia> work study position, programmin'
[04:00:23] <aschneid> Speaking of IRL job, I need to be up in the morning myself and it's 1:00 am here on the west coast, so I'm heading out myself
[04:00:40] <member68> alright. see you later
[04:00:51] <danopia> it's basically an app for a NFC tablet (might be custom, but probably not once the hardware gets there) that one would use to organize their clothes and find matching outfits and such... "Smart Closet"
[04:01:16] <danopia> the entire team except one and another dev are girls, and the first interview question awas "are you comfortable with dealing iwth women's clothing" :P
[04:01:21] <danopia> except me and*
[04:01:44] <aschneid> What would you need the NFC for?  The clothes will be tagged?
[04:01:51] <danopia> yes
[04:01:52] <alextsc> meh we should really move more of the relevant discussions to the mailing list, those IRC logs are terrible to read QQ
[04:02:17] <danopia> well, the hangers, i assume. not filled in on all the details yet
[04:02:32] <danopia> bye
[04:02:40] <aschneid> later
[04:02:48] <alextsc> cya
[04:03:09] <aschneid> alextsc…I would be more than happy (in the morning) to post something on google groups with a summary of the chat logs
[04:03:15] <aschneid> Just wasn't sure if it was worth it.
[04:03:30] <aschneid> Especially considering we have decided on the apps yet...
[04:03:35] <Hogofwar> danopia, why couldn't you say: the entire team are girls except two
[04:03:45] <aschneid> All the ones I voted for though probably could use an imgur framework.
[04:03:47] <alextsc> yeah that decision has to come soon
[04:04:02] <alextsc> there seems to be some interest in certain apps
[04:04:03] <aschneid> Anyway, I'm out….talk to you later this morning.
[04:04:14] <alextsc> alright, cya :)
[04:04:25] ### aschneid is now known as aschneid|away
[04:06:09] ### deliwien has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[04:07:44] <member68> it's interesting to read the "what do you want to work on"-poll resultse
[04:08:01] <ThatPlayer> Are you going to share? =P
[04:08:14] <member68> many people suggest getting to work quickly and sort out organizational stuff later
[04:08:56] <ThatPlayer> It'll keep people interested I'd think
[04:08:57] <alextsc> =)
[04:09:16] <alextsc> well i think we got decent organization for now
[04:09:21] <alextsc> we should really get started asap
[04:09:27] <alextsc> before things fall apart
[04:09:38] <alextsc> if we build one or two throwaway project, hey who cares?
[04:09:50] <alextsc> but we will learn from that
[04:10:33] <member68> also, we got about 50 devs, of which 10 know something about UI design. only one person who wants to be PM though
[04:10:45] <Fault> member68: How many have signed up for being lead dev/PM atm?
[04:10:52] <Fault> oh
[04:10:55] <Fault> nvm
[04:11:25] <alextsc> i stated it in the comment section; I think the lead will get determined when we got teams set
[04:11:32] ### Fault is now known as RAWR
[04:11:51] <alextsc> "i want to lead project X" when its not even decided that this is going to get built is kinda pointless
[04:12:00] <RAWR> True
[04:12:01] ### aschneid has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[04:12:01] <alextsc> (imho)
[04:12:30] <joholz> ok guys
[04:12:33] ### Hogofwar has quit the server. (Ping timeout: 246 seconds)
[04:12:33] <joholz> nite
[04:12:44] <alextsc> good night :)
[04:12:54] ### joholz has quit the server. (Quit: Page closed)
[04:13:52] <alextsc> brb shower, the nerd smell is taking over :>
[04:14:18] <member68> alextsc, we're posing the question differently. we ask "do you want to lead a project, if yes, which one?"
[04:14:24] ### matt-ice has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[04:15:14] <matt-ice> sup
[04:16:27] <member68> i'm starting to get the feeling though, that we should just start and find out that way of organization works. i think we'll have a few people who are assigned to multiple projects to set the general direction of development. besides that, teams would more or less on their own.
[04:16:38] <member68> any opinions on that?
[04:17:00] <ThatPlayer> Sounds great
[04:17:15] <matt-ice> interesting... I agree
[04:17:44] <member68> sound chaotic to me right now, but I guess as a community, there is no right or wrong way
[04:20:16] <member68> i was just going over the table again. only one person put down management, however about 10 people added projects they want to lead
[04:20:38] <TheNumb> member68: since we have people all around the globe some portion of work could be done say by the guys in the US and then it'd be taken over by the guys from EU to keep the things rolling ;-)
[04:20:48] ### anyonethinkingab has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[04:21:08] <TheNumb> I mean, taken over by the end of the day in the US :P
[04:21:16] <TheNumb> If you know what I mean.
[04:21:29] <TheNumb> That's what big players do ^^
[04:21:35] <matt-ice> TheNumb: once this goes in full swing it will be the fastest dev team in the world :) 24/7 coding
[04:21:43] <TheNumb> matt-ice: yeah.
[04:22:20] <TheNumb> ^^
[04:22:40] <member68> we have the advantage that we are a small team. it's easier to coordinate.
[04:23:02] <member68> but getting everybody to an acceptable level of coding experience is a big task
[04:23:10] <member68> but we'll get there
[04:23:18] <deliwien> yeah, the timezone is something we have to think about when choosing the team members
[04:23:29] <TheNumb> member68: we'll have to get there ;p
[04:23:53] <matt-ice> member68: TheNumb for this the educational app would be great
[04:24:11] <matt-ice> get the best to work on that and then education can begin for the rest of us
[04:24:40] <TheNumb> Well, I think I could join guys from Germany as we are in the same timezone.
[04:29:24] <member68> when you say educational app, do you mean a "how to write for android" app?
[04:30:41] <matt-ice> member68: that, also java tutorials, text/video based, I dont have an exact idea for that, Im refering to what was posted on /r/
[04:31:28] <member68> the app itself is easy to write. but we would we get the content?
[04:31:37] <TheNumb> member68: redditors :D
[04:31:55] <TheNumb> We could also spam a little on /r/java and /r/androiddev
[04:33:55] ### markerz has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[04:35:39] <alextsc> and back :)
[04:36:22] <alextsc> member68, yes, I know that the question was worded that way. The "project to lead" decision is one point.
[04:36:31] <TheNumb> alextsc: and welcome back ;D
[04:36:35] <alextsc> thanks :)
[04:37:07] <alextsc> i thought about PM for myself, but I decided that there are not enough infos yet for me
[04:37:24] <alextsc> i dont have any open source experience at all, let alone leading a project
[04:37:41] <alextsc> i mean, i can dive into that, if i write code or emails for 2 hours a day doesnt matter
[04:37:51] <alextsc> as long as i have the feeling to help and contribute
[04:38:16] <member68> i don't have much experience either. but i'm motivated and i have some time i can spend on it.
[04:38:20] <alextsc> but the project should be at least interesting for myself
[04:38:29] <alextsc> and i want to know the team beforehand
[04:38:43] <alextsc> 15 chaotic redditors are more of a challenge than 8 dedicated people
[04:38:45] <member68> btw, everybody, a reddit client seams to get the most interest from people willing to lead teams
[04:38:48] <alextsc> (if that makes sense)
[04:39:06] <member68> true, alextsc
[04:39:08] <alextsc> i dont want to start on hard-mode basically :)
[04:39:45] <TheNumb> So, how many designers do we have?
[04:39:53] <member68> it's hard to judge people you have never worked with before. that's what the initial projects are for. getting people up to speed, and to find out who actually is ready to do some work
[04:40:03] <member68> thenumb, let me check
[04:40:34] <member68> by desigerns, you mean interface and graphics?
[04:40:36] <alextsc> right
[04:40:39] <TheNumb> member68: yes
[04:41:15] <member68> 15 designers
[04:41:26] <TheNumb> Wow
[04:41:28] <TheNumb> That's nice
[04:41:42] <alextsc> indeed :o
[04:41:52] <member68> some of them are UI only though.
[04:41:58] ### zubsani has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[04:42:09] <member68> but we got a nice group here
[04:42:32] <TheNumb> We'll also need people with experience in backend/api development :<
[04:43:00] <alextsc> I think we got some from what I've seen
[04:46:29] <anyonethinkingab> member68 we have a good amount of possible PM's
[04:47:14] <matt-ice> do you think that a reddit client would be a good idea? I know there are many and there is always room for one more... but unless this would bring something truly new, we would be just making a copy of f5, reddit is fun, reddionic, baconreader etc tec
[04:47:48] <TheNumb> matt-ice: it would be great.
[04:47:58] <TheNumb> matt-ice: Reddit client from redditors.
[04:48:06] <member68> do any of you know how i have to set up github to allow the following workflow: somebody wants to change code -> new branch -> code must be approved by a experienced dev(could be part of a guthub team). i think currently everybody can push code without any review process
[04:48:10] <matt-ice> TheNumb: arent all of them from redditors?
[04:49:53] <TheNumb> matt-ice: dunno ;D
[04:50:37] <matt-ice> TheNumb: ok, lets brainstorm here, what could we have the client do that hasnt been done?
[04:50:54] <TheNumb> Ummm...
[04:51:03] <TheNumb> Less cluttered ui :D
[04:51:36] <TheNumb> Image gallery when browsing subreddits like /r/pics /r/funny
[04:51:57] <wjoe> Morning all
[04:51:57] <anyonethinkingab> a bit more like 9gag, but then on a phone/tablet
[04:51:58] <markerz> You dont necessarily have bring something new to the table.  It can be as simple as redesigning the UI.
[04:52:00] <TheNumb> wjoe: oahi
[04:52:01] <anyonethinkingab> morning
[04:52:16] <TheNumb> anyonethinkingab: haaaaai
[04:52:21] <anyonethinkingab> lol
[04:52:44] <TheNumb> :D
[04:52:47] <zubsani> hi guys
[04:52:50] <matt-ice> the best UI I had was reddionic
[04:53:01] <wjoe> Sounds like there's been progress overnight?
[04:53:03] <matt-ice> no flashy animations, just speedy reddit
[04:53:09] <zubsani> open this site on your phone/tablet http://rheza.github.com/9pics/
[04:53:24] <zubsani> we don't need another app for replicate the 9gag experience

[04:56:11] <anyonethinkingab> yup
[04:56:13] <anyonethinkingab> i made it
[04:56:14] <member68> anyonethinkingab, leave the http and www?
[04:56:30] <anyonethinkingab> member68 in the channel description
[04:56:34] <zubsani> why ?
[04:56:45] <anyonethinkingab> to vote on a project we will make
[04:57:04] <anyonethinkingab> have you looked at it?
[04:57:15] <matt-ice> polls polls polls!!! where is our poll voting app? it could be the greatest circlejerk of all time!
[04:57:20] <zubsani> i already fill in exactly same form like 6 hours ago
[04:58:22] <anyonethinkingab> it was updated once, but it should be the same one indeed if it was only 6 ours ago
[04:58:53] <anyonethinkingab> yeah zub you already filled that poll in :D

[05:06:10] ### zubsani has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[05:06:45] <member68> i'm reading up on what pull requests are. haven't quite figuered that out
[05:07:41] <alextsc> yeah, i don't have much experience myself with git(hub), apparently you need pull requests to do any codereview
[05:08:29] <alextsc> if you need somebody to test the workflow throgh, hit me up
[05:08:35] <alextsc> through that is
[05:10:56] <member68> looks like i have to fork the project, create a new branch in the fork, commit changes to the branch, and then i can create a pull request to have it added back to the main project

[05:11:25] ### zubsani has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[05:13:48] <alextsc> mhm does it make sense to branch in this case; opposed to the fork + pull-request only?
[05:14:08] <alextsc> i really have to read up on git a bit :D
[05:15:01] ### RAWR has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[05:17:24] <RAWR> Ughh why does the website have overflow:hidden? Can't see the whole thing on my netbook D:

[05:18:28] ### markerz has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[05:21:04] <RAWR> Oh... because of the gradient I see. :/
[05:22:58] <zubsani> i will try to create new website as soon as possible
[05:25:29] <member68> if you send me code to add another gradient at the bottom, i'll add it and make it scrollable
[05:27:42] <zubsani> so, you only want me to add another gradient at the bottom, and make it scrollable ?
[05:27:53] <member68> pretty much
[05:27:56] <zubsani> i planing to create something with bootstrap
[05:28:03] <zubsani> planning*
[05:28:09] <zubsani> http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/examples/hero.html
[05:28:31] <zubsani> ok, i will see what i can do.
[05:35:27] <alextsc> argh, git + windows + eclipse; that's the stuff. Wonder if I'll ever get it working. :D
[05:36:22] <member68> windows + eclipse + egit = piece of cake
[05:36:35] <alextsc> starts to explode for me once i touch it
[05:36:49] <alextsc> unknow exception while executing ls-remote command Oo
[05:36:51] <wjoe> hehe
[05:36:59] <wjoe> I started using smartgit on windows. it's pretty nice
[05:37:08] <alextsc> brb googling :P
[05:37:27] <member68> are you working on a fork? i took away push permissions from everybody
[05:37:38] <member68> *everybody working on the main project
[05:37:48] <wjoe> is there actually a project to work on now?
[05:38:06] <alextsc> working is a bit of an overstatement
[05:38:06] ### markerz has quit the server. (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[05:38:11] ### markerz has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[05:38:13] <member68> nope, we're figureing out github right now
[05:38:14] <alextsc> i forked it and try to make changes
[05:38:17] <alextsc> still cant check it out
[05:38:27] <alextsc> because of setup issues
[05:38:48] <wjoe> ah :/
[05:38:57] <alextsc> maybe i should reboot into my linux install :>
[05:39:09] <wjoe> I was worried then for a minute. I saw new commits on github, but hadn't seen any on redmine. turns out you just did them between when I checked
[05:39:12] <wjoe> still working fine \o/
[05:39:20] <member68> workflow should be: create fork, add fork to eclipse, make changes, commit changes, push changes, create pull-request, have pull-request approved by project maintainers
[05:39:23] <wjoe> haha. I do find linux easier for development. especially android
[05:39:56] <alextsc> yeah, also great to have a usable command line
[05:40:12] <alextsc> but the window manager situation is terrible at the moment  :>
[05:40:15] <wjoe> yeah, seriously
[05:40:26] <wjoe> kinda :/ I just went with xfce
[05:40:37] <member68> first world problems :p
[05:40:42] <wjoe> hehe
[05:40:47] <alextsc> I'm currently on KDE, havent used that in years
[05:40:57] ### rapidfyre has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[05:41:01] <alextsc> well it's so shiny, shopping with my girlfriend has less glitter stuff
[05:41:09] <alextsc> gnome3 bad, unity bad :>
[05:41:13] <alextsc> terrible QQ :D
[05:41:21] <wjoe> indeed D:
[05:41:41] <wjoe> yeah, never used KDE myself. bit much eyecandy, but beats unity/gnome3 at least
[05:41:52] <alextsc> yeah i try to tone it down
[05:42:00] <alextsc> just have to change over 9000 settings
[05:43:06] <member68> i like my windows task bar ;) no worries about window managers
[05:44:24] <alextsc> hehe
[05:44:59] <wjoe> xfce is about right for me. it works well enough, and looks fine. doesn't get in the way at least
[05:45:00] <markerz> If you guys are interested, reddit-dev has git pretty much figured out
[05:45:07] <markerz> Opps
[05:45:15] <markerz> Wrong window.
[05:45:37] <markerz> But I guess it still applies.

[06:22:55] ### RAWR has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[06:23:47] <member68> I think I need a grammar checker for irc. the more I type, the more errors I make
[06:24:14] <member68> either a grammar checker or more time to type ;)
[06:24:48] <Billd> I need to remember to disable bugsense from my development build. My logs are going to be so cluttered :(
[06:25:56] <member68> idea: Android app to slow down time...I'll put it on my to do list. that would be such a great selling point. take that apple!
[06:26:09] ### RAWR has quit the server. (Remote host closed the connection)
[06:27:01] <alextsc> :D
[06:27:15] <Billd> I'd buy that at $.99.
[06:27:15] <alextsc> slowing time; that seems to be an eclipse feature

[06:36:10] <lyrch> how many votes were submitted to the app poll?
[06:36:55] <lyrch> enough to give some choices or not enough to be useful?
[06:37:18] <member68> about 70 people
[06:37:36] ### markerz| has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[06:37:36] ### markerz has quit the server. (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[06:37:43] <lyrch> not bad
[06:38:06] <member68> enough to pick the first few apps
[06:38:38] <lyrch> yup
[06:39:35] ### zubsani has quit the server. (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)
[06:40:02] <anyonethinkingab> It would be great if we could divide the teams by friday
[06:40:52] <lyrch> that sounds easily doable if we choose apps today
[06:41:25] <member68> do you want to add 1 or 2 simple apps that people can work on individually to get to know android development? simple calculator for example. i'd put together a layout and people can write the code
[06:43:49] <lyrch> that sounds like a good idea, should the apps have comments in them with suggestions on how to complete the code?
[06:46:14] <member68> yes, but little to no pre-written code. for example: we can point people to onclicklisteners for handling buttons but we add the actual methods
[06:46:34] <member68> *but we don't add the actual methods
[06:47:30] <lyrch> agreed, i was thinking along the lines of comments pointing to tutorials the explain what they need and how it works

[07:22:02] <anyonethinkingab> looks good, who made that?
[07:22:10] <lyrch> member68: nice, simple and effective
[07:22:43] <member68> people can fork it, write the methods and can add functionality if the want
[07:22:52] <anyonethinkingab> set the start number to 0
[07:23:17] <member68> forgot about 0 ;)
[07:23:21] <anyonethinkingab> solution spoiler: then always do *10+(number), right?
[07:23:22] <member68> I'll add it
[07:27:27] <lyrch> just looking at that makes me want to break out my "learn android" books again, so i can remember how to set layout properties correctly
[07:30:01] <wjoe> android layout stuff is one of those things I just end up having to look up every time
[07:30:06] <member68> there we go: http://i.imgur.com/p8Uh8.jpg
[07:31:05] <alextsc> wow nice
[07:31:12] <alextsc> well done
[07:31:44] <member68> should be good enough for now
[07:32:19] <wjoe> looks good. is this going to be one of the projects then?
[07:32:41] <anyonethinkingab> haha member i meant that there was a 0 in the edittext when you start
[07:32:59] <anyonethinkingab> but that is java, no?
[07:33:12] <anyonethinkingab> oh no, nvm
[07:35:26] <member68> it's just a quick layout for a calculator. nothing fancy. nothing is optimized and i didn't really care for all naming conventions. i put in some bad coding pratices, too (like hard coding strings)
[07:37:06] ### markerz has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[07:37:07] ### markerz| has quit the server. (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[07:38:19] <lyrch> tsk tsk, we're supposed to teach good habits from the beginning ;)
[07:38:23] <alextsc> ^
[07:38:28] <alextsc> :P
[07:39:19] <member68> i know. i'll fix the strings
[07:40:20] <alextsc> hehe. yeah the rest doesn't matter. But strings.xml is basic stuff that should be shown, unless you want to search and move tons of strings later on
[07:43:46] <lyrch> though that is something we could catch if we are going to use a code review tool like gerrit (i remember seeing something about it, but i left before it was decided)
[07:45:10] <alextsc> I think we are doing code-review-light through github before merging commits
[07:45:35] <alextsc> a major codereview tool is certainly nice, but lets get started first and see how it works out
[07:46:19] <lyrch> cool, i've become a big fan of code reviews before merging. my last job was working in the stone age and at my new job i've seen the light
[07:47:36] <member68> i love gerrit. i don't know how to set it up
[07:48:00] <member68> if we could get that done i would go for gerrit any time
[07:48:38] <member68> github code review isn't anywhere near as nice as gerrit
[07:49:10] <lyrch> we have gerrit at my work, i'll see if i can get a tutorial from the people who set it up here. or at least pointed to some good setup docs
[07:49:52] <wjoe> is gerrit a thing that's included in github, or would that need to be set up somewhere?
[07:50:20] <lyrch> i think it would need to be setup elsewhere
[07:51:15] <wjoe> I could look into installing it on my server, not got so much time today though
[07:55:30] <lyrch> yeah it looks like a pretty serious time investment to setup, and, from a couple stackoverflow questions i've read, it could be tricky to setup with github
[07:56:06] <lyrch> it's not impossible, but the code-review-light looks like a good option for the moment
[07:56:16] <wjoe> yeah, I was just reading up on it. not sure how nicely it plays with github
[07:56:24] <member68> the cyanogenmod project has it setup. I'll contact them and ask them about it
[07:56:25] <lyrch> yeah
[07:56:32] <wjoe> sounds like a plan
[07:56:48] <lyrch> well do they run their repositories on private servers or on github?
[07:56:48] ### markerz| has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[07:56:49] ### markerz has quit the server. (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[07:58:50] <wjoe> I believe they use github, maybe mirrored elsewhere though
[07:59:19] <wjoe> https://github.com/cyanogenmod
[07:59:39] <lyrch> cool
[08:03:52] <wjoe> there is a code review plugin for redmine, but I have no idea how that compares to other options http://www.redmine.org/plugins/codereview
[08:07:06] <member68> in my head i have the following workflow: people add the repo to eclipse, make changes, commit them. after that experienced developers (and possibly the community as well) can approve or deny the commit.
[08:07:56] <wjoe> pretty much. by the sound of it though, if you want to use gerrit, code would have to be pushed to that first, then reviewed there, then pushed to github
[08:08:27] <member68> pushing to github should be automatic
[08:08:51] <wjoe> from gerrit?
[08:09:30] <lyrch> yes
[08:09:44] <member68> i think so. otherwise projects like cyanogenmod with hundrets pf pushes a day would stop because of all the extra work
[08:10:25] <lyrch> gerrit sits in between the developers and the main repo. when the code gets approved by another developer and the tests pass, gerrit then pushes the code change on to the main repository
[08:10:57] ### RAWR has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[08:12:39] <member68> that way anyone can add code, but only good code gets added. an issue tracker determines what direction the project is heading and what code people should write. people can assign themselves to issues to work on them. i a system like that, duplicated work is non-existant
[08:14:00] <lyrch> yup, and it prevents any bad code from entering (e.g. breaks other code, bad coding style, etc.)
[08:16:37] ### markerz has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[08:16:37] ### markerz| has quit the server. (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[08:19:07] <member68> alternative idea: a gerrit repo and we mirror code on github
[08:19:25] ### RAWR has parted (left) the channel.
[08:20:15] <member68> scrap that idea. i misunderstood some forum post
[08:20:30] <wjoe> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3724101/github-gerrit-hudsonjenkins-workflow
[08:20:35] <wjoe> the post on here makes some sense
[08:20:42] <wjoe> (though I'm not sure what jenkins/hudson is)
[08:20:57] <lyrch> it's a continuous integration server
[08:20:59] <lyrch> good stuff
[08:23:21] <lyrch> the second answer is the workflow we're looking for, so it's possible
[08:23:45] <wjoe> yeah, it sounds good. I think the issues of github and gerrit not playing well are mostly old news
[08:24:08] <wjoe> only problem is, it's a bit awkward to pull from one repo, then push to another. I guess git has some way of dealing with that though
[08:24:44] <member68> devs only deal with gerrit
[08:24:59] <member68> oh wrong
[08:25:15] <wjoe> would they pull from gerrit too though? surely gerrit would be full of unapproved stuff, unless it's branched somehow
[08:25:24] <wjoe> hm
[08:25:31] <lyrch> nope, they would pull from github
[08:25:52] <wjoe> that's what I thought, but then how do you pull from one repo but then push to another?
[08:26:06] <member68> eclipse can do that without problems
[08:26:12] <lyrch> i know that when i set up my workspace at my job there were a few git config options that i needed to set for the workflow
[08:26:39] <member68> so workflow is: pull from github, make changes, commit changes to gerrit, have them approved, gerrit pushes changes back to github
[08:26:46] <lyrch> bah, IDEs. commandline and vim all the way
[08:26:53] <wjoe> I'm sure git has a way to do it.. probably add another remote or something. not sure
[08:27:29] <member68> we'll figure it out. first we'd need to set up gerrit though.
[08:28:15] <wjoe> looking into it now
[08:31:08] <member68> great
[08:31:34] <member68> btw, i have to leave in about 30 minutes. I'll be back in 2-3 hours though
[08:33:09] <wjoe> huh, gerrit is a google thing? didn't know that
[08:33:38] <member68> i was quite surprised when the getting started doc linked to the android dev guide ;)
[08:35:27] <wjoe> I didn't realise until it crashed, and the package names were com.google :p
[08:35:46] <wjoe> http://lc8n.com:8080/ well that's not quite there

[09:16:51] <adamell> Good morning
[09:17:06] <veeti> hi
[09:17:10] <veeti> gerrit?
[09:17:22] <adamell> I see that we're still in the voting perioud
[09:17:29] <adamell> *period
[09:17:35] <veeti> hopefully that changes tonight
[09:17:42] <adamell> yay!
[09:17:53] <adamell> In that case i'll go have some breakfast
[09:20:13] <nataly> "tonight" - in what time zone?
[09:20:32] <wjoe> 13:13:27 < lyrch> interesting, what version are you using? 2.2, or 2.3?
[09:20:36] <wjoe> tried both :/
[09:20:54] <wjoe> [2012-03-21 13:20:06,978] WARN  / : Error in allQueryNext
[09:20:55] <wjoe> java.lang.IllegalStateException: Missing project All-Projects
[09:21:05] <wjoe> that's the error I'm getting
[09:21:11] <wjoe> (among other long stack traces)
[09:23:38] <lyrch> wjoe, i think we're using 2.2
[09:23:56] <lyrch> that's a weird error
[09:24:10] <wjoe> I've tried 2.2.2.1 and 2.3-rc0
[09:24:24] <wjoe> yeah. absolutely nothing for it on google
[09:24:38] <lyrch> i do know that we are using gerrit as the git repo also, so we only have one repo
[09:24:59] <veeti> huh
[09:25:58] <veeti> github will be used for the repositories
[09:27:04] <lyrch> yeah, but we've seen projects using github for the repo and gerrit for code review, so it's possible
[09:27:31] <veeti> i'm a bit skeptical about that
[09:27:38] <veeti> what's wrong with github pull requests
[09:27:43] <veeti> gerrit sounds a bit overkill at least for now
[09:27:56] ### RAWR has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[09:28:35] <lyrch> it is, but it's nice to look into for the future

[09:31:39] <lyrch> a code review will still have to take place for any commit, gerrit is simply a very good tool for doing it

[09:42:02] <slick8086> is that functionality lacking in redmine?
[09:42:50] <wjoe> There is a code review plugin for redmine, but I'm not sure how well it compares
[09:43:00] <lyrch> there's a plugin for redmine, but no one is really sure how it works. plus github does have the capability, just a light version

[10:30:33] <anyonethinkingab> kk
[10:30:36] <anyonethinkingab> ahm
[10:30:53] <anyonethinkingab> 74
[10:31:11] <anyonethinkingab> minus a few
[10:31:17] <itsKitsos> not bad
[10:31:17] <anyonethinkingab> let's say 68
[10:31:31] <anyonethinkingab> no not at all
[10:31:41] <anyonethinkingab> we got a decent amount of possible managers
[10:31:55] <itsKitsos> that's good because we have a decent amount of projects to manage :p

[10:42:45] <wjoe> one problem with redmine: everything uses real names, which don't always translate well to people's usernames on reddit/IRC
[10:44:09] <wjoe> so, if Alexander Boden is someone here: I've installed the eclipse connector plugin in redmine that you requested
[10:44:21] <wjoe> but I don't know if it works, can't test with eclipse right now

[11:06:27] <anjoyed> also redmine doesn't automatically pick up the extra repos
[11:06:36] <anjoyed> ony shows 1 out of 3
[11:06:59] <wjoe> yeah, they have to be added menually. also there's only one per project anyway (which mostly makes sense)
[11:07:16] <Hogofwar> veeti,
[11:07:42] <anjoyed> aye, makes sense
[11:07:52] <wjoe> I could add the others, but I don't think we really need a project section for IRC logs, and I'm not sure what the other repo is for
[11:10:01] <anjoyed> is here any way to have new repos under github.com/RedditAndroidDev added automatically?
[11:10:06] <anjoyed> *there
[11:10:24] <anjoyed> like github.com/RedditAndroidDev/projectName
[11:11:28] <wjoe> don't think it'd be possible. you can only set github to notify other sites for each repo. and as it is, I can only add a new one myself via command line, I have to clone the repo to my server
[11:11:38] <Hogofwar> wonder if they will allow a repo for the logging bot
[11:12:04] <wjoe> isn't that what the IRC_Logs repo is?
[11:12:14] <anjoyed> aye
[11:12:14] <Hogofwar> i mean, the source of the bot
[11:12:30] <Hogofwar> tht repo just holds the logs from the bot
[11:12:41] <anjoyed> that could be handy
[11:13:01] <anjoyed> if each project ends up with a irc channel
[11:13:08] <anjoyed> they can set up own bot
[11:13:20] ### AuthorityAction has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[11:13:52] <red_sky> yeah
[11:14:18] <wjoe> oh, did someone here code it? I assumed it was some bot that someone else made
[11:14:23] <red_sky> Hogofwar did
[11:14:30] <Hogofwar> oh hey red_sky
[11:14:35] <red_sky> using PIRC bot as a base
[11:14:39] <red_sky> hello
[11:14:49] <Hogofwar> red_sky, did something happen with your vps?
[11:14:49] ### markerz has quit the server. (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[11:14:58] ### markerz has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[11:14:59] <red_sky> I have migrated the IRC bot to a different server
[11:15:09] <red_sky> so it shouldn't lose connection anymore
[11:15:12] <wjoe> ahh. could be good to have a repo for it then. could just make your own repo, we can fork it into the RAD repos if needed later on?
[11:15:22] <Hogofwar> I could
[11:15:24] <red_sky> my vps has been dropping connection left and right... so I'm trying this new one out.
[11:15:38] ### member68 has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[11:15:47] <member68> !Upload
[11:15:48] <red_sky> since the transfer, the bot hasn't lost connection AFAIK
[11:16:06] <red_sky> try lowercase u
[11:16:13] <member68> !upload
[11:16:16] <red_sky> I'm not sure if it's case sensitive
[11:16:21] <member68> hello everybody
[11:16:24] <anjoyed> hey
[11:16:28] <member68> Uppercase worked earlier
[11:16:30] <wjoe> what's !upload for?
[11:16:30] <Hogofwar> it isn't
[11:16:34] <red_sky> ah, okay
[11:16:35] <anjoyed> !logs
[11:16:39] <Hogofwar> upload is op only
[11:16:41] <wjoe> !help
[11:16:56] <Hogofwar> only two commands
[11:17:04] <red_sky> just wasn't sure, because it doesn't seem to have uploaded.  the last upload was only a few minutes ago
[11:17:06] <Hogofwar> I'm gonna add in a 3rd one though
[11:17:18] <Hogofwar> red_sky, as i said, op only
[11:17:22] <anjoyed> you should have added !hogs
[11:17:32] <red_sky> Hogofwar member68 was the one who tried it.
[11:17:34] <anjoyed> make it slap everyone in room or something
[11:17:44] <Hogofwar> he isn't op
[11:17:49] <Hogofwar> wait
[11:17:50] <Hogofwar> no
[11:17:58] <Hogofwar> i just didn't scroll up my user list :P
[11:18:09] <Hogofwar> it shoulda worked?
[11:18:20] <wjoe> got a few scripts running in another channel, but most would probably be a bit too spammy for here
[11:18:22] <red_sky> let me check the config.txt
[11:18:41] <Hogofwar> sky17 pushed to master at RedditAndroidDev/IRC_Logs 2 minutes ago
[11:18:47] <Hogofwar> are you sure that isn't it
[11:18:49] <wjoe> things like dictionary definitons, google translate, unit/currency conversion
[11:18:57] <red_sky> hmm, mine says 4 minutes ago
[11:19:01] <red_sky> perhaps it is working
[11:19:03] <Hogofwar> red_sky, try having a different commit message if it is forced
[11:19:12] <red_sky> if I could find my source code, I had a really good translate command
[11:19:22] <wjoe> well, mine's just a java program
[11:19:31] <wjoe> then it's executed through some perl script
[11:19:34] <red_sky> I'll be home this weekend, I can try to get it then.
[11:19:38] <Hogofwar> red_sky, try having a different commit message if it is forced
[11:19:44] <red_sky> I saw
[11:19:56] <wjoe> source for most of them is on git.lc8n.com
[11:20:03] <wjoe> er, blatech.co.uk actually
[11:20:36] <anyonethinkingab> member68 have you filled the poll in yourself?
[11:20:47] <wjoe> tweeting from the channel could be useful for ops maybe
[11:21:23] <wjoe> I should probably fill in the poll. I don't really mind what we develop really :p
[11:21:33] <member68> not yet. i'll do it in a few minutes
[11:21:37] <red_sky> Hogofwar is there any way to reload the config without restarting the bot?
[11:21:47] <Hogofwar> No
[11:21:51] <red_sky> okay
[11:21:51] <Hogofwar> I can make that though
[11:21:54] <anyonethinkingab> i'll spam it again: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dGxpZ21UUTlvSHdPM3U5VWNUb1V3Vmc6MQ
[11:23:13] ### RadLogii has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[11:23:32] <red_sky> member68 could you use !upload again?
[11:23:32] <member68> i removed everybody but redsky from the irc log project
[11:23:36] <member68> !upload
[11:23:45] <red_sky> there
[11:23:50] <garychencool> I believe most of the user names on IRC correlate to the ones on reddit..?
[11:23:55] <wjoe> yeah, it's hard to keep track of the real names. it wouldn't be so bad if it actually showed their nicks when you click on the name, but it just shows emails
[11:23:56] <Hogofwar> Pretty much
[11:23:58] <wjoe> likely
[11:23:58] <member68> that way you shouldn't get any project irc bot related news
[11:24:03] <red_sky> yeah, mine does, and my github name is close enough
[11:24:22] <garychencool> well all of my names are the same (yippe), on this, reddit, github, redmine, etc
[11:24:23] <Hogofwar> member68, cool
[11:24:38] <Hogofwar> member68, is it appropriate for the IRC logging bot to have a git on the page?
[11:25:28] <wjoe> I'm surprised I managed to get my nick on reddit and github really
[11:25:44] <wjoe> not that it's exactly a common name, but it's 4 letters
[11:25:50] <Hogofwar> True
[11:25:52] ### sam___ has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[11:26:01] <member68> dunno. we could log to a ftp server instead of github if people wanted that
[11:26:23] <red_sky> I think that was the plan originally
[11:26:25] <Hogofwar> member68, I mean the source for the bot, not the logs
[11:26:44] <red_sky> but someone suggested github because of the infinite storage and because it's right there with everything else
[11:26:47] <garychencool> my name's my name
[11:26:58] <Hogofwar> wjoe, there are 456,976 combinations of 4 letters, so I guess that's pretty small
[11:27:22] <wjoe> haha. quite a few, but yeah
[11:27:48] <member68> hogofwar: i don't think we need the bot source on github. it's not exactly relevant to writing android apps
[11:28:13] <Hogofwar> 208 827 064 576         8 letter combinations
[11:28:27] <wjoe> maybe just make a repo for it on your own github page?
[11:28:28] <Hogofwar> member68, i'll just upload it to my own github
[11:28:32] <Hogofwar> wjoe, yep
[11:28:55] <wjoe> as much as I like hosting my own stuff (I have my own git server and gitweb here), github does look really good
[11:29:08] <member68> hogofwar: ok, if people ask I'll send them your way
[11:29:18] ### blaise| has quit the server. (Quit: Bye)
[11:29:22] <Grillon> feel free to post it here :)
[11:29:32] <Grillon> or just put your github name so I can find it there
[11:29:33] <red_sky> hogofwar, I'll probably make a branch pretty soon
[11:29:49] <red_sky> fork, maybe
[11:29:51] <member68> i still can't believe we have 500 people watching the subreddit
[11:29:53] <red_sky> depending on what you want
[11:30:37] <Hogofwar> Grillon, github name is hogofwar :P
[11:30:55] <Hogofwar> red_sky, haha what do you plan to add?
[11:30:59] <garychencool> I believe GitHub barley goes down? y/n?
[11:31:09] <member68> github is stable
[11:31:11] <Hogofwar> You guys also get to laugh over my terrible programming
[11:31:15] <red_sky> I can help with things member68 suggested
[11:31:24] <Hogofwar> red_sky, what things?
[11:31:27] <red_sky> like google translate
[11:31:31] <Hogofwar> oh, that crap
[11:31:43] <Hogofwar> So you are turning the log bot into a multi-purpose one
[11:31:49] <red_sky> oh, nevermind
[11:31:57] <Hogofwar> red_sky, i'm not against it
[11:32:05] <red_sky> wjoe suggested that stuff, haha, xchat gives him the same name color as member68
[11:32:23] <red_sky> hmm, you know, I like the idea of having extra features
[11:32:27] <Hogofwar> Hell, I already made a multi-purpose plugin-based IRC bot
[11:32:31] <red_sky> but with that comes the possibility of spam
[11:32:40] <Hogofwar> That supported Python + Java plugins
[11:32:45] <red_sky> hmm, not bad
[11:32:46] <Hogofwar> Holy shit was that a mess to code
[11:33:07] <Hogofwar> It could have been improved a ton though
[11:33:12] <red_sky> at the very least, perhaps I can look over what you have now and see if there's ways to improve what already exists
[11:33:17] <Hogofwar> Like event listeners of sorts instead
[11:33:28] <wjoe> oh, well I was saying I have some scripts in another channel for things like that. then again, it's kinda an awkward system
[11:33:36] <Hogofwar> red_sky, hell, just telling me how to improve would be tremedously helpful to me
[11:33:42] <wjoe> it runs java and C++ and all sorts of programs, rather than actually scripting it directly in perl
[11:34:04] <wjoe> but yeah, I was thinking those sorts of things might be a bit spammy for here, but I don't mind either way
[11:34:07] <red_sky> ah, that is weird
[11:34:16] <red_sky> I think it's ultimately up to the OPs
[11:34:34] <wjoe> yeah, none of us knew perl so we just wrote stuff in whatever language we felt like. as long as it deals with stdin and stdout, it works
[11:34:37] ### markerz has quit the server. (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[11:34:40] ### markerz| has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[11:34:56] <Hogofwar> red_sky, added a config reload
[11:35:04] <red_sky> nice
[11:35:12] <Hogofwar> gonna add the last command i can think of now
[11:35:14] <member68> be careful who can change the bot. i don't want a bot that replaces the word "app" with "kitten" everytime someone says it ;)
[11:35:20] <Hogofwar> Gonna rip it from my other bot
[11:35:35] <red_sky> I don't think it can modify messages before they are posted
[11:35:35] <Hogofwar> I hope to god I didn't write it in python
[11:35:39] <Hogofwar> I can never translate it well
[11:35:42] <red_sky> it would have to hook into the server itself
[11:35:49] <red_sky> which I think would pose a huge security risk
[11:36:01] <wjoe> haha. yeah, definitely can't do that
[11:36:15] <wjoe> I host an IRC server, but I wouldn't even know how to do it with that, let alone freenode
[11:36:35] <Hogofwar> wooo! didn't write that bit in python!
[11:36:43] <member68> it would confuse everybody who reads the logs later on: "let's write an Android KITTEN!"
[11:36:53] <anjoyed> :)
[11:36:54] <Hogofwar> Ah, the logs
[11:37:05] <red_sky> oh, right, the logs
[11:37:28] <red_sky> that would be hilarious, though
[11:37:31] <member68> at least let the ops disable it !kittenModeOff
[11:37:35] <red_sky> lol
[11:37:57] <red_sky> someone that I know had a plugin where the bot would just say random things
[11:37:59] <red_sky> it was funny
[11:38:22] <wjoe> write an android kitten, with your leopard?
[11:38:53] <anjoyed> forking kittens
[11:39:34] <member68> but if we put that into the kitten, we might get in big trouble later
[11:40:01] ### lacop has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[11:40:04] <wjoe> fork the kitten, then clone it, edit it's source, and push it?
[11:40:15] <wjoe> then someone else can pull it
[11:41:05] <red_sky> Reddit Android Developers, forking git repos one kitten at a time.
[11:42:20] <member68> lacop must be seriously confused right now ;)
[11:42:31] <anjoyed> was thinking that :)
[11:42:48] <lacop> hey guys
[11:42:55] <lacop> yeah a lot :)
[11:42:55] <anjoyed> hey
[11:43:01] <lacop> what's new?
[11:43:29] <lacop> btw, no idea who is in charge of redmine, I think member68 - I've added myself to the about page, I hope that's ok
[11:44:08] <Hogofwar> egomaniac
[11:44:25] ### aschneid has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[11:46:34] <member68> there are a few that have admin status on redmine
[11:46:51] <member68> but it's ok. good to have that list
[11:46:58] <wjoe> no one specific 'in charge' of it really, it's on my server but others have been setting things up. I think, if you've been given access to edit stuff, it's fine :p
[11:47:07] <lacop> I guess I joined a little too late so I wasn't there
[11:47:24] <wjoe> I should add myself to that list. I got stuck at trying to think of what my 'strengths' are :(
[11:47:24] <lacop> not that it's important, but it's nice to have a headcount and timezone info
[11:47:38] <lacop> wjoe, be sneaky, omit that point
[11:47:42] <lacop> nobody will notice
[11:47:42] <wjoe> haha
[11:48:02] <wjoe> Skills: Java, C++. Weaknesses: Java, C++
[11:48:56] <lacop> how's the idea poll going? should be 24 hours soon
[11:49:16] <member68> going great. at least 60 people voted
[11:49:53] <wjoe> is there a poll up for logos, or are we still taking submissions?
[11:50:09] <Raionic> Any idea what idea is leading the pack?
[11:50:35] <member68> wjoe: --> reddit sidebar
[11:51:25] <member68> Raionic, i'll find out, give me a few minutes
[11:51:29] <wjoe> well, doesn't entirely answer the question if there's a poll up somewhere else :p
[11:51:38] <wjoe> but I'll assume that means we're still taking submissions
[11:52:03] <member68> yes, there is a poll, link is in the sidebar
[11:53:34] <wjoe> I only see a poll for apps, not logos
[11:54:11] <Raionic> Cool
[11:55:12] ### markerz| has quit the server. (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[11:57:37] <member68> wjoe --> We'd love to see your ideas for a new logo. Submit there here.
[11:58:00] <wjoe> that's submissions, not a poll :p
[11:58:13] <wjoe> unless you're just counting upvotes as votes or something
[11:58:28] <member68> do we have a poll?
[11:58:30] <red_sky> so, can I re-emphasize that all of our apps should have common theming?
[11:59:15] <red_sky> for the same reason that Steve Jobs always wore a black sweater, it helps establish the entity in people's minds
[11:59:39] <lacop> red_sky, well, I agree with a common theme, but lets not make it an unique thing
[11:59:50] <lacop> just follow the design guidelines and it will be consistent
[12:00:24] <lacop> we can have our own little things to stand out, but keep the general look of the guidelines
[12:01:13] ### alextsc has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[12:02:04] <red_sky> I really like the guidelines
[12:02:10] <red_sky> but we can follow them and still be unique
[12:03:19] ### sam___ has quit the server. (Quit: Page closed)
[12:03:51] <lacop> red_sky, if you are bored and have some ideas you can make sketches / mockups
[12:03:59] <Raionic> I think it would suffice to require the logo be displayed on all screens
[12:04:12] ### LogiiBot has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[12:04:13] <lacop> but it'll probably be better to wait for the app, then do the UI designs
[12:04:15] <Raionic> Because you would design an app different from a game usually

[12:04:53] <Hogofwar> lacop, it's the log bot
[12:04:56] <Hogofwar> just testing a new feature
[12:04:59] <Hogofwar> and it's my own
[12:05:02] <red_sky> I could possibly do that... but not soon
[12:05:09] <red_sky> I have an exam on monday and a speech tuesday
[12:05:13] <lacop> Hogofwar, java?

[12:06:59] <LogiiBot> The log has been uploaded and is at:  http://sprunge.us/ZHhB
[12:07:02] <lacop> so you have a list of integers and want counts?
[12:07:06] <Raionic> Excel
[12:07:10] <member68> list of strings
[12:07:13] <Hogofwar> WOOOO
[12:07:15] <lacop> use a hashset, increment each key

[12:07:30] ### LogiiBot has quit the server. (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[12:07:33] <Hogofwar> Anyway
[12:07:44] <lacop> hashset.set(key, hashset.get(key)+1);} else {
[12:07:47] <member68> isn't there an app for that?
[12:07:50] <lacop> hashset.set(key, 1);}
[12:07:57] <member68> or some excel or word function?
[12:08:03] <wjoe> excel can, yeah
[12:08:08] <lacop> oh ... well, there is a unix tool that does that, forgot the name
[12:08:16] <wjoe> but, I'l rusty on spreadsheet stuff
[12:08:17] <member68> I'm kinda lazy right now ;)
[12:08:18] <lacop> but excel should do it
[12:08:20] <wjoe> *I'm
[12:08:21] <wjoe> hehe
[12:08:35] <wjoe> I'm fairly sure the function is just COUNT
[12:08:40] <wjoe> but you probably need to do something weird to give the total of each
[12:08:46] <veeti> if you're talking about the spreadsheet
[12:08:49] <veeti> form -> summary
[12:08:51] <Raionic> Yes just replace the delimeter with a comma save it as a csv then open in excel
[12:09:01] <wjoe> grep piped to wc would also do it in linux
[12:09:09] <lacop> member68, cat file | uniq -c
[12:09:13] <Raionic> Then you can count all "a" and all "b"
[12:09:21] <wjoe> ...ok, maybe something can do it even better
[12:09:53] <wjoe> uniq looks pretty good
[12:10:21] ### red_sky has quit the server. (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[12:11:30] <member68> you can edit the spreadsheet if you want
[12:11:38] <member68> ups, that was for lacop
[12:13:58] ### markerz has joined ##reddit-android-developers

[12:14:58] <wjoe> looks like people want to make a reddit app
[12:15:11] <Raionic> Woo hoo go tamagotchi!
[12:15:54] <member68> wjoe: i doubt that. who in their right mind would ever go to reddit, you know, with all the child pornographers and rapists there :p
[12:16:28] <member68> it's not like any of us ever go there
[12:16:56] ### joholz has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[12:17:02] <member68> but seriously, i thing the direction is rather clear
[12:17:08] <member68> *think
[12:17:18] <joholz> hola
[12:17:46] <wjoe> haha
[12:18:21] <wjoe> I just think making a reddit app is a bit unnecessary when there are lots already, and some (well, probably all) are made by redditors
[12:18:40] <wjoe> but clearly they're not good enough if that many people want to make one :p
[12:19:48] <member68> i think we could start with a reddit quick submit app, and work on a client later on. we can merge both projects later if we want to
[12:20:38] <member68> tamagochi sounds fun, we'll need some people who know how to create the graphics
[12:20:54] <member68> and a google tasks client isn't that hard either.
[12:21:17] <Sanit> Tamagochi sounds way too advanced for a first project
[12:21:27] ### tmoskowite has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[12:21:53] <anjoyed> added some eclipse/egit stuff to the wiki if someone that knows git wants to check it
[12:22:03] <anjoyed> http://rad.lc8n.com/projects/general-organization/wiki/Github
[12:22:28] <Hogofwar> anjoyed, add touch
[12:22:49] <veeti> git commit -m "Fixed bug #124"
[12:22:54] <veeti> commit messages need to be more detailed than that
[12:23:05] <veeti> and not just a reference to a bug number
[12:23:22] <anjoyed> yeah, I just did the eclipse bit below that
[12:23:42] <veeti> oh
[12:23:49] <veeti> i'll fix the above stuff
[12:24:29] <lacop> veeti, well, if it's a trivial fix to a ticket you can look it up by the number, but it should be a little more than that
[12:24:48] <lacop> ie, fixed ticket #123 - <how it was fixe, why, ...>
[12:24:49] ### garychencool has quit the server. (Quit: Page closed)
[12:25:04] <lacop> something short, more stuff can be said on the ticket discussion page
[12:25:33] <lacop> wow netbeans is sooo slow... takes like 3 secs to alttab to it
[12:25:40] <lacop> something went terribly wrong there
[12:27:00] <nataly> good morning =]
[12:27:33] <veeti> commit messages should be decipherable without an issue tracker
[12:28:14] <veeti> so a good example would be "Fix [short description of bug]" and "fixes #999" after that
[12:28:54] <member68> commit message have to include WHAT was fixed, but not how, when or why
[12:30:25] <member68> wjoe, any news on the gerrit error you had?
[12:31:06] <veeti> is gerrit really necessary
[12:31:09] <veeti> github already has pull requests
[12:31:23] ### vcarl has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[12:31:32] <Raionic> Btw ...that was just an example guys. Not a standard
[12:32:13] <member68> i tried it but it's quite complicated. it also requires very few people to approve all commits. with gerrit, we can offload some work to everybody who wants to help
[12:32:16] <wjoe> member68: not so far. busy day today, so I haven't had a chance to look at it properly. I've got a few ideas to try later
[12:32:33] <member68> alright. thanks
[12:32:44] <veeti> are you saying that pull requests are more complicated than gerrit
[12:33:02] <member68> based on my experience, yes
[12:33:27] <veeti> i don't really understand how you could come to that conclusion
[12:34:17] <Hogofwar> what is gerrit
[12:34:18] ### markerz has quit the server. (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[12:34:19] ### markerz| has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[12:35:05] <lacop> code review
[12:37:28] <wjoe> well, nothing can be worse than the code review system we had in one group I worked with - pastebinned the diffs and waited for someone to look at it in a week or so
[12:38:18] <member68> veeti: have you worked with both systems?
[12:38:39] <member68> wjoe: sounds like the project manager was an idiot
[12:39:21] <wjoe> old fashioned, at least. he had the right idea, having code review rather than everyone pushing commits to the main repo. he was just completely unaware of any systems liked this
[12:41:07] ### nataly has quit the server. ()
[12:44:36] <member68> gerrit is rahter new, too. let's give him the benefit of the doubt ;)
[12:45:43] <wjoe> hehe, yeah
[12:46:04] ### Esge has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[12:52:29] <Hogofwar> Hm
[12:52:42] <Hogofwar> Trying to figure out how to read a file line by line backwards
[12:53:18] <vcarl> best i've ever gotten is read it in and read it backwards from memory, or reverse it before re-reading it :|
[12:53:43] <lacop> Hogofwar, find some file handling class in java that has seek
[12:53:56] <lacop> seek to the end, then keep moving back for as long as you want
[12:54:12] ### markerz has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[12:54:13] ### markerz| has quit the server. (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[12:54:52] <lacop> Hogofwar, http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/channels/SeekableByteChannel.html#position(long)
[12:56:01] <member68> going by the preliminary results we'll probably start on the following projects: reddit quick submit, google tasks client, IRC client, alarm clock, as well as 2 simple projects for newbies
[12:56:05] <lacop> if you are trying to get last x lines from an irc log that should be easy, seek to -x*512 from the end (512 is the maximum command length for IRC, so that will be always enough)
[12:56:32] <lacop> then split by newlines and take last x (there could be a bit more if it's a lot of short messages)
[12:56:52] <lacop> member68, 6 projects?
[12:57:09] <lacop> how many people do we have? there is like 30 in the google group, much less on the redmine
[12:57:20] ### ballpointcarrot has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[12:58:35] <Sanit> I have a small bit done already for the RQS project. I'll upload it to my GH later tonight.
[12:58:35] <member68> that's actually 4 projects + two projects that can be done individually
[12:59:46] <member68> i put together a quick layout for a calculator app earlier. i'll upload it and people have to add functionality. i'll add comments to point people the right way so they can learn by doing
[13:00:02] <vcarl> lacop, we have almost 60 people in IRC right now, thats not half bad to work on 4 + 2 projects
[13:00:16] <lacop> vcarl, most people are inactive here
[13:00:49] <vcarl> yeah, but given the fractured nature of how all the different places were set up, it's not unreasonable that people haven't joined everywhere
[13:01:16] <member68> i think we'll have 30-50 active devs. some of them won't do much, others will do more
[13:01:29] <member68> if we have too many people, we can always add projects
[13:01:48] <ballpointcarrot> we do have a decent pool of projects to pull from.
[13:02:48] <member68> we have to remove tetris from the list though --> license issues
[13:04:05] <Sanit> Any license issues with Tamegachi?
[13:04:27] <vcarl> Sanit, i'm sure that's flexible enough that we could just call it something else and get by
[13:05:23] <vcarl> tetris is hard to do "differently" than the original and still have it actually be good

[13:16:15] <lacop> I'm looking for something cheap, I don't need a lot of bandwidth or ram/diskspace
[13:16:22] <veeti> www.intovps.com
[13:16:33] <veeti> amazing support
[13:16:37] <Hogofwar> lacop, what country?
[13:16:37] <veeti> usually replies in like 5 minutes
[13:16:38] <vcarl> i know red_sky has some stuff going
[13:17:00] <lacop> Hogofwar, well, slovakia, but there is not much local stuff
[13:17:07] <Hogofwar> k
[13:17:08] <lacop> for all I care the server could be on moon
[13:17:19] <Hogofwar> lacop, what do you plan for it
[13:17:38] ### wjoe has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[13:17:49] <lacop> Hogofwar, running some stuff for personal use - irc server, also an irc relay for myself, stuff like that
[13:18:14] <veeti> irc can be problematic
[13:18:16] <lacop> I need like 256/512 ram, maybe 5gb diskspace (+size of OS)
[13:18:17] <veeti> many budget hosts don't allow it
[13:18:35] <lacop> not even a relay?
[13:18:43] <lacop> or whatever it's called ...
[13:18:48] <veeti> well
[13:18:56] <veeti> i'm using a bouncer on intovps with their permission
[13:19:02] <veeti> their tos forbids all irc access
[13:19:03] <lacop> that's what I meant
[13:19:10] <lacop> hmm, that's pretty weird
[13:19:49] <lacop> but thanks for the tip, it looks rather good
[13:19:56] <lacop> I'll bookmark it for future research
[13:21:42] ### red_sky has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[13:24:28] <Hogofwar> red_sky, lacop wants you
[13:24:39] <lacop> rawr :)
[13:24:48] <lacop> just wondered what VPS hosting you use
[13:24:52] <lacop> looking for some tips
[13:26:00] <Hogofwar> I personally use amazon's VPS
[13:26:06] <Hogofwar> The micro tier so it's free
[13:26:41] <Hogofwar> not big enough for what you want though lacop
[13:29:10] <lacop> I guess I really need to put together a server and run it myself

[13:43:53] <member68> I'd like to get some suggestions for pointing people the right way for a simple calculator app. the layout: http://i.imgur.com/p8Uh8.jpg
[13:45:10] <tmoskowite> move the numbers to the bottom right
[13:45:12] <member68> i'd like them to figure out writing onclicklisteners for the buttons as well as how to use findViewbyID for accessing the result edittext
[13:47:54] <member68> any ideas how to teach them and maybe give them some comment-based guidelines?
[13:48:01] <RAWR> member68: Perhaps a button for decimal points? Or whatever they're called
[13:48:53] <Airheebz> may also want to put the numbers to start at bottom instead of top, seems off to me
[13:49:14] <RAWR> Yeah like on the numpad
[13:50:05] <lacop> member68, move the whole keyboard down, make the "display" multiline so that it can show some history
[13:50:51] <member68> ok, i changed the numbers
[13:51:07] <tmoskowite> Um
[13:51:12] <member68> remember guys, this is supposed to be an easy project
[13:51:18] <tmoskowite> make sure they don't stack activities
[13:51:30] <member68> it's target are people who have never written an android app before
[13:51:44] <lacop> well, they can start small
[13:51:55] <joholz> looks good
[13:52:00] <tmoskowite> you could have them use a content provider to share
[13:52:05] ### itsKitsos has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[13:52:09] <tmoskowite> their mathematical results with the world =)
[13:52:15] <lacop> lol
[13:52:17] <itsKitsos> How's it going guys
[13:52:20] <lacop> put in a facebook button
[13:52:29] <lacop> "share this number with your friends!"
[13:52:37] <member68> they'll get the layout, nothing else. some comments and guidelines, but that's pretty much it
[13:52:42] <tmoskowite> ok
[13:52:50] <joholz> sounds nice
[13:52:58] <tmoskowite> is include/merge too much?
[13:53:04] <member68> yes
[13:53:09] <tmoskowite> ok
[13:53:15] <lacop> member68, sounds good :) make sure to provide the basic app structure what will load the layout, with proper configs and setup guide
[13:53:15] <tmoskowite> Then you are set
[13:53:23] <tmoskowite> OOOO
[13:53:27] ### markerz has quit the server. (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[13:53:29] <tmoskowite> you could teach them
[13:53:31] ### markerz| has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[13:53:36] <tmoskowite> to build it in XML and in the activity itself
[13:53:41] <lacop> gotta go, be back in a few hours
[13:53:47] <tmoskowite> do 2 different apps that are indentical, but built differently
[13:53:49] <joholz> later
[13:53:51] <tmoskowite> identical
[13:53:56] <member68> this calculator is the easiest app, i have to think of anther one which is harder. after that they should be able to assist those who are already working on collaborative projects
[13:54:10] <joholz> you could teach them a ton of different things, which are all basic and all important...but this is a fine start
[13:54:55] <joholz> imo
[13:56:27] <member68> looks like there's a lot an android dev should have heard of

[13:57:11] <joholz> @member68, thats a good idea
[13:57:29] <garychencool> Back, now using androirc
[13:57:59] <joholz> we all missed you
[13:58:19] <garychencool> Not sure if trolling or serious
[13:58:22] <markerz|> Basic xml structure and activity lifecycle
[14:00:36] <markerz|> Does applicationstates include saving and restoring states?
[14:01:41] <red_sky> ah, sorry
[14:01:54] <red_sky> I was talking to my coworkers about a recent Washington Post article
[14:02:12] <red_sky> lcaop, I've been having issues with YardVPS
[14:02:16] <red_sky> lacop*
[14:02:19] <red_sky> so I can't recommend them
[14:02:41] <red_sky> I am trying out ChicagoVPS for the month

[14:04:21] <red_sky> $7/mo (March Madness Deal), on ChicagoVPS, you get 2048MB RAM guaranteed, 50GB disk space, 2TB Bandwidth, an a virtual quad core CPU
[14:04:30] <red_sky> it's OpenVZ, but has great specs for the price
[14:08:30] <Sanit> I've started a Doc to plan the Reddit Quick Submit app. Add to it if you wish: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S3ac4dxseKTFrIhUJ0OWX7jXLvIbTf5ncFhSzLc1VuE/edit
[14:09:41] <member68> further planing should be done via redmine. i'll create a project there

[14:12:00] <Sanit> Cheers

[14:15:07] <red_sky> I can probably get started on something next week.  I have a ton of things to do this week.\
[14:15:25] <red_sky> Though, I suppose I can contribute here and there.  I just don't think I can do the core framework at this point in time.
[14:19:14] ### wjoe has quit the server. (Ping timeout: 244 seconds)
[14:20:06] <member68> actual coding won't start before we have gerrit up and running
[14:20:21] <member68> i'll create the projects though so planning can start today

[14:22:51] <garychencool> Androirc has ads but I don't really see them
[14:22:55] <member68> please write me a pm if you need extended rights on your project (this means you want to lead the project or contribute more than the average user)
[14:23:06] <ThatPlayer> Morning people
[14:23:37] ### Avid has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[14:25:19] <red_sky> okay, I can do that
[14:25:29] <red_sky> at some point, I can definitely see myself leading a project / contributing more
[14:25:41] <red_sky> but as the school year is beginning to wind down, there's a ton of stuff going on
[14:26:00] <garychencool> I recommend adding it to the site, Reddit, information document, etc. If you haven't done so already
