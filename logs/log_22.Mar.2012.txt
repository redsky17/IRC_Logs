[00:00:05] <ballpointcarrot> Sanit has taken point for the most part; put together the inital github repo. It was forked to the RAD org, and looks like there's an issue and a pull request waiting.

[00:08:00] <Sanit> not working fully, I'm fairly tired so I will have a look at it tomorrow if no one fixes it while I'm away.
[00:08:01] <jaimeh> Sanit did we figure out what a name space for all projects?
[00:08:13] <Sanit> it was either the long one or the short one
[00:08:20] <Sanit> I don't think we decided
[00:08:48] <jaimeh> Tomorrow morning should be better as all the international people should be on.
[00:09:46] <Sanit> international relative to who?
[00:10:15] <jaimeh> I just mean everyone is more likely to be up in 8 hours.
[00:11:34] <Sanit> ah yeah. it's 4:12am where I am now, so I should be back for a short bit in 6 or 7 hours

[01:49:29] <ballpointcarrot> joholz: make sure you've pulled so you have the most up-to-date code in your tree first.
[01:49:47] <ballpointcarrot> chances are, someone pushed between the last time you pulled and your push.

[02:05:55] <smirk> but freenode is the shiz
[02:06:24] <joholz> im doing alright, playing around with git atm
[02:07:10] <joholz> is it possible to write a commit on every file (custom commits for files)
[02:07:45] <smirk> whats that?
[02:08:13] <smirk> git atm?
[02:08:25] <joholz> GitHub at the moment
[02:09:09] <smirk> i cant wait till i get another computer
[02:09:29] <joholz> haha i can tell, what happened to you old one?
[02:09:32] <joholz> just too old?
[02:09:43] <danopia> joholz, what do you mean by "on every file"?
[02:09:48] <smirk> so i can google more easier
[02:09:56] <danopia> you're free to address every file in your message
[02:10:44] <joholz> danopia, so it would be git add Blah.... and then i would just do git commit ?
[02:10:55] <smirk> car hit me n fucked all me and it up
[02:10:57] <danopia> joholz, yes
[02:11:06] <joholz> that would make commit to that file, and do that for all files i want to make custom messages?
[02:11:26] <joholz> smirk: sry to hear that
[02:11:29] <smirk> cussing offensive?
[02:11:45] <smirk> its cool
[02:11:46] <joholz> I am 10 what is this?
[02:12:21] <smirk> im just happy to live

[02:12:51] <smirk> broke me legs
[02:13:33] <ballpointcarrot> joholz: you're trying to just commit the changes on one file?
[02:14:09] <smirk> yea im happy to find this dev resource and i cant wait to jump back into programming
[02:14:30] <joholz> ballpointcarrot, well I am just adding a ton of files, and would like to make custom commits to specific files
[02:15:24] <smirk> what ar e commits?

[02:23:15] <smirk> sorry if it seems stupid of me to be asking. im on a wii and if i google i loose channel window
[02:23:57] <ballpointcarrot> smirk: a commit is a list of changes submitted to a git repo.
[02:24:54] <joholz> smirk: the commit helps other users who are looking at the project understand what you changed, by only taking a quick glance
[02:25:28] <joholz> smirk: what games you got for wii?
[02:26:53] <smirk> shit im gonna have to wait for my computer. i wont ask no more newb q's. hope its cool if i still kick back. i eventually will participate and not be so lame
[02:27:44] <joholz> feel free to ask q's
[02:28:15] <smirk> mario kart n wii sports... its my moms.. shes kinda helping me while im hurt
[02:29:03] <joholz> did you hack the wii yet?
[02:29:17] <smirk> whats a git repo ?
[02:29:58] <ballpointcarrot> git is a source code management system. repo is short for repository (where the code goes)
[02:30:11] <smirk> you mean for pirated games?
[02:30:30] <ballpointcarrot> nope.
[02:30:45] <ThatPlayer> I think he was talking to joholz =P
[02:31:06] <ballpointcarrot> no, I'm just confused at this point. :)
[02:31:21] <joholz> lol me too
[02:31:27] <ThatPlayer> Well I could be wrong, I'm constantly distracted =)
[02:31:31] <smirk> so what he wants to do with file is for programmer and not an actual user yet?
[02:32:42] <smirk> im not confused at all :p
[02:33:07] <ballpointcarrot> smirk's "you mean for pirated games?" I interpreted as talking about git (hence, 'Nope.') he was actually talking about the wii hacking.
[02:34:02] <joholz> lol no necessarily for pirated games... theme change, flow covers, dvd player
[02:34:10] <ThatPlayer> But who does that? =P
[02:34:42] <smirk> only thing i hacked with a wii is myself up into a freenode channel
[02:34:49] <joholz> lolz, well of course you can BACKUP your games
[02:35:12] <ThatPlayer> Well it loads faster off a USB than disc
[02:35:35] <smirk> lol@ backup games
[02:35:38] <joholz> my hacked wii is screwing up playing sports resort, i need to fix that
[02:36:09] <smirk> oh i got sports resort too

[03:14:47] <joholz> although all the commits seem to be hitting: https://github.com/Joholz/TestGit/commits/master
[03:15:00] <smirk> you blaze it?

[03:18:04] <smirk_> so you party or what player?
[03:18:28] <joholz> the commits you see in my commit history...shouldnt they be showing in the repo home page as messages?
[03:19:06] <adamell> joholz: you don't really ever commit one file. you can, but when you command it to commit it usually figures out what's changed and what hasn't and commits only the necessary files for you anyway
[03:19:19] <smirk_> n/m

[03:20:09] <adamell> joholz: which repo are you talking about?
[03:20:20] <joholz> https://github.com/Joholz/TestGit
[03:20:55] <smirk_> commits are associated with online files? not files at the machine?
[03:21:17] <joholz> i do git add "specific file or whatever" .... git commit -m "this is the specific file or whatever" ... git push origin master
[03:21:23] <adamell> They're all there up to 10 minutes ago
[03:21:34] <member68> smirk: please read our wiki at http://rad.lc8n.com/projects/general-organization/wiki
[03:22:04] <joholz> but the messages are 2 hours ago. the "test commit for git"
[03:22:16] <member68> this might help you understand a lot of the terms we use a whole lot better
[03:22:43] <adamell> oh you mean on the front page? not the commit history page?
[03:22:52] <member68> joholz: walk me through your workflow real quick
[03:23:04] <smirk_> i will soon as i get me puter running again. i cant even sign up to that site from my wii
[03:23:42] <c0smic> smirk_: You don't need to sign up for it, just browse the wiki for answers
[03:23:47] <adamell> joholz: go to terminal (if on mac) and type 'git status'
[03:23:48] <joholz> hold on, im getting a pastebin setup
[03:24:03] <smirk_> someone said i could ask q's when i apollogized for newb questions

[03:29:56] <adamell> *$ git status
[03:30:12] <adamell> or just paste it here, it shouldn't be more than one line
[03:30:32] <member68> try using "git commit -a"
[03:30:42] <member68> that adds all changed files

[03:30:48] <smirk_> yall have a good night ima watch some movies on netflix. see yall in the morning
[03:30:54] <joholz> yea its telling me to use git commit -a
[03:31:19] <adamell> yeah. git status usually points you in the right direction
[03:32:03] <joholz> right after file delete, "branch is ahead of origin/master by 1 commit"

[03:37:38] <ballpointcarrot> since git questions have been a common event tonight, I highly recommend taking a look at this: http://book.git-scm.com/index.html
[03:37:46] <ballpointcarrot> also, if anyone has questions, I'll be willing to answer them.
[03:37:48] <member68> sure, go ahead. anybody can add their suggestions

[04:43:14] <Archelaus> I was wondering how I would go about getting into one of the many teams you guys have goin'
[04:44:34] ### RAWR has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[04:44:41] <adamell> Send a $50 made out to C.A.S.H. and send it to the prince of Nigeria
[04:45:15] ### anjoyed is now known as prince_of_nigeri
[04:45:39] <Archelaus> unfortunately i do not fall for that
[04:45:50] <prince_of_nigeri> nuts
[04:45:52] <Archelaus> not to brag, i did get an email from the queen of tibet
[04:45:54] <adamell> lol
[04:46:07] ### prince_of_nigeri is now known as anjoyed
[04:46:21] <member68> do we still need the alpha project on github?
[04:46:22] <Archelaus> she needs 1,000 pounds to feed the hungry and will pay me back as soon as she can
[04:47:30] <member68> Archelaus: click on the project and you should see a sign up link on the right
[04:48:06] <Archelaus> https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dHFNdllONnVlMWNnQ095M0VaRkxBMFE6MQ ?
[04:48:28] <Archelaus> ensure I have the correct part, the amount of times I've accidentally signed up for gmail is redic ;) ;P

[04:49:31] <Archelaus> Ah, redmine, this is something I've very much so familiar with
[04:50:51] <member68> I'll remember that if I run into problems ;)
[04:52:26] <anjoyed> don't think the alpha is necessary any more really
[04:53:08] <anjoyed> well
[04:53:22] <anjoyed> is it still the only repo hooked up to redmine?
[04:53:53] <adamell> Reddit-Quick-Submit is too
[04:54:05] <anyonethinkingab> member68:  have you started any other projects since the release of the poll results 10 hours ago?
[04:55:04] <member68> anjoyed: yes. I'll get to that later.
[04:55:05] ### markerz| has quit the server. (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[04:55:10] ### markerz has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[04:55:21] <member68> anyonethinkingab: to redmine or to github?
[04:55:32] <anyonethinkingab> both
[04:56:12] <member68> redmine, i don't think so, github, yes, just a few minutes ago
[04:56:41] <anyonethinkingab> is the calculator a project?
[04:57:03] <anyonethinkingab> or just something to learn from?
[04:57:35] <member68> it's a project for beginners
[04:57:54] <member68> everybody can work on it, but it won't be collaborative
[04:58:00] <anyonethinkingab> oh ok
[04:58:08] <anyonethinkingab> so it's not actually a project
[04:59:03] <member68> i added it so that people can join it and start discussions if they need help. but it's not something that will be worked on together
[04:59:14] <anyonethinkingab> should i begin contacting the PM's, or do you think the current amount of project is alright?
[05:00:03] <anyonethinkingab> or will you do that?
[05:00:13] <member68> i think it's a good start. we can add projects anytime anyway
[05:00:26] <member68> why do you want to contact the PMs?
[05:00:43] <anyonethinkingab> ok. I just don't have the feeling that they know they can/should start
[05:00:55] <anyonethinkingab> because i can't really do much elso for the moment
[05:01:04] <member68> problem is: we don't have gerrit set up yet
[05:01:04] <anyonethinkingab> and i want to be involved
[05:01:08] <anyonethinkingab> oh
[05:01:20] <member68> so for now, we can only do planning but no actual coding
[05:01:26] <anyonethinkingab> kk
[05:01:48] <anyonethinkingab> I'll pm them on reddit throughout the day
[05:02:36] <c0smic> member68: Who is setting up gerrit?
[05:02:45] <member68> wjoe
[05:03:02] <anyonethinkingab> right now or...?
[05:03:31] <c0smic> Gotcha
[05:03:38] <member68> haven't talked to him yet today. i asked him quite often yesterday and don't want to piss him off
[05:03:49] <c0smic> anyonethinkingab: He's started it, not sure if he's working now
[05:03:55] <anyonethinkingab> oh ok
[05:03:59] <member68> yesterday he sais something about getting it done today
[05:07:38] <member68> i updated the github info page at http://redditandroiddev.github.com
[05:08:02] <member68> it's just cosmetics but it's better than an empty html file
[05:09:41] <anyonethinkingab> haha i just noticed this in the results
[05:09:58] <adamell> Oh you have the g-tasks repo  up too
[05:10:14] <anyonethinkingab> Mobile Reddit app got 34 % of the public votes, but only 14% from PMS
[05:10:47] <anyonethinkingab> while "Reddit Client" got only 25% from the public but did get 27% from PMS
[05:12:13] <member68> might have something to do with the order in which apps were show. also as a PM voting for an app includes a bigger commitment than for a developer. developers can do multiple apps, PMs will probably do 1-2 projects only
[05:12:27] <anyonethinkingab> hmm yes
[05:12:36] <anyonethinkingab> unlike you lol
[05:12:41] ### alextsc has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[05:12:50] <anyonethinkingab> 4 projects
[05:13:43] <member68> i'll pitch in whereever i can help. don't know if i will really be a PM or if I can direct that to somebody else who has more time
[05:14:01] <member68> organzing everything takes up a lot of time right now
[05:14:12] <member68> maybe it'll get better with time ;)
[05:14:17] <adamell> Where's the submission description for the g-task-client app?
[05:14:23] <anyonethinkingab> should i add to the spreadsheet that a PM is still needed?
[05:14:41] <member68> sure

[05:14:59] ### markerz has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[05:15:00] <member68> i didn't add a description yet because I couldn't come up with one last night
[05:17:22] <adamell> We'll if it's what I think it is and there are the proper API's available I'll PM it.
[05:17:39] <adamell> I remember trying to create a google reader API once open source
[05:17:42] <adamell> it was hell
[05:17:47] <adamell> and it never really got going
[05:18:09] <adamell> too many bugs because google kept updating everything to it
[05:18:37] <adamell> then they eventually made their own API.
[05:18:50] <anjoyed> added a bit more info to the mylyn page
[05:20:17] <member68> thanks
[05:26:40] <adamell> I looked through the reddit submissions for the description of the g-t-app but couldn't find one
[05:27:24] <adamell> Is it just syncing your google tasks (gmail, calendar, etc) to your phone?
[05:28:04] <adamell> There's a Google Tasks API too
[05:28:15] ### Avid has quit the server. (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[05:28:57] <adamell> could you sign me up for PM on rm/gh?
[05:30:52] <adamell> But introducing a new dependency (google api) would require Maven for the devs. I'll get to writing the wiki on it as soon as the RM page is up.
[05:30:58] <member68> added you on rm. github won't have PMs. only admins and gerrit will be able to push code
[05:31:26] <adamell> thanks
[05:32:04] <Archelaus> member68, I'm unsure if you're currently adding developers, but I'd like to be one on the IRC Project for when you are
[05:33:35] <member68> have you created an account on redmine and applied for the project?
[05:33:43] <anyonethinkingab> adamell what are you PM for now?
[05:33:57] <Archelaus> I'm Archelaus on the RM, I'm yes
[05:33:58] <adamell> Kony Liberation Councel

[06:00:21] <anjoyed> haven't heard new album yet, bought soldier after he did an AMA
[06:00:22] <adamell> only you and Kony
[06:00:38] <Hiver> 2012, we're taking it back.
[06:00:50] <member68> i code to cuban music, bueno vista social club and stuff like that ;)
[06:01:14] <member68> besides that jazz, soul and some blues ;)
[06:01:23] <c0smic> I like to code to electronica, like Com Truise: http://soundcloud.com/com-truise
[06:01:36] <Hiver> I dig on BVSC, but they let my mind drift too much. I prefer something driven.
[06:01:57] <adamell> another ghostly fan
[06:02:06] <anjoyed> member68, you tried Manu Chao?
[06:02:17] <adamell> I usually listen to Loscil or Lusine
[06:02:38] <Hiver> C0smic, this would work. Thanks for the link.
[06:02:46] <c0smic> adamell: Nice, I also listen to Mux Mool
[06:02:58] <member68> anjoyed: love them :)
[06:03:03] <c0smic> Hiver: np!
[06:03:10] <anjoyed> good stuff :)
[06:03:58] <member68> problem is while coding i have to focus on text, i can't have music with english or german lyrics
[06:04:26] <c0smic> Same, that's why most of what I listen to is electronica :)
[06:04:36] <anjoyed> aye, usually go for jazz if doing heavy coding. jon coltran type tsuff
[06:04:39] <c0smic> I also like rainymood
[06:05:19] <member68> solo piano music + rainymood ;)
[06:06:06] <c0smic> I should try listening to some Miles Davis or maybe Art Blakey..
[06:06:22] <anjoyed> miles davis is excellent
[06:06:53] <c0smic> Dave Brubeck too
[06:07:06] <c0smic> ahh, so much good music

[06:08:46] <adamell> I was thinking Reddit Android Developers Google Task Client
[06:08:52] <adamell> but it seems lengthy
[06:09:02] <anjoyed> RAD Google Task List?
[06:09:08] <anjoyed> *Client
[06:09:13] <adamell> We also get a logo!
[06:09:52] <adamell> RAD GTL?
[06:09:58] <adamell> no
[06:10:39] <c0smic> RAD Google Tasker?

[06:10:49] <adamell> i like that
[06:11:39] <adamell> Does everybody else?
[06:11:48] <anjoyed> +1
[06:12:41] <adamell> done

[06:22:29] <adamell> what's a google account of yours that I can add to the RAD Google Tasker API access list?
[06:22:32] <Hiver> :) I love it when I go to bed after banging my head against the desk, wake up, write a few lines, and my code suddenly works as expected.
[06:25:37] <ThatPlayer> Sleeping is always good, I'm going tod o taht soon =P

[06:27:14] <anjoyed> John Smith
[06:27:36] <ThatPlayer> I like John Doe better
[06:27:45] <anjoyed> that works too
[06:27:51] <c0smic> ThatPlayer: +1 lol
[06:28:23] <c0smic> I wonder how companies do it?
[06:29:10] <ThatPlayer> I remember getting a Google+ account disabled because I used asdf as my name
[06:29:20] <adamell> lol
[06:29:31] <adamell> \o/
[06:29:51] <ThatPlayer> Yeah, had to update the name and all taht
[06:29:52] <member68> john doe is legal name, so we should be fine
[06:30:08] <adamell> we're only allotted 5,000 queries a day
[06:30:20] <adamell> Let's hope it doesn't get too popular
[06:30:22] <ThatPlayer> Are you setting up a Google Apps account?
[06:30:27] <adamell> Yeah
[06:31:07] <ThatPlayer> Are we going to get a marketplace license thing on the same account?
[06:31:19] <anyonethinkingab> member68:  i sent all the messaged
[06:31:21] <adamell> Not sure
[06:31:33] <member68> great
[06:31:54] <member68> i created redditandroiddevelopers@googlemail.comw
[06:32:08] <member68> we can use it for apis, a market accout, etc

[06:58:53] <adamell> yup
[06:59:10] <anyonethinkingab> so you want another PM with you or is alone ok?
[06:59:24] <anyonethinkingab> do*
[06:59:26] <adamell> The RAD GTasker app is plenty
[06:59:34] <anyonethinkingab> ok ok
[07:00:17] <adamell> The dependencies are a nightmare. They haven't integrated the Tasks API into the regular Google API yet and it's all very messy.

[07:52:21] <anyonethinkingab> I've lead a few, but not for Android.  Most of my work has been individual, but teamwork was also part of learning Java.

[08:00:55] <member68> he sounds like a good candidate though. sanit can lead the way until tehsusenoh has more time. by then the project has grown and we might need two pms

[08:03:11] <adamell> danopia: that's dope
[08:03:39] <member68> anyonethinkingab: yes. i think he had the idea too

[08:05:06] <Hogofwar> Not to be rude, but is there a point for fatal1ty to be a mod?
[08:05:17] <member68> does anyone know a free dns like freedns?

[08:07:14] <member68> i have a domain but my hoster won't let me assign an A recored leading to an external host
[08:07:22] <Hogofwar> that sounds shit
[08:07:36] <Hogofwar> member68, does that mean you are forced to host with them?
[08:07:48] <member68> basically i want to go to dev.redditandroiddevelopers.com and see our redmine
[08:07:58] <member68> my contract expires in autumn
[08:08:02] <member68> i'll change it then
[08:08:25] <Hogofwar> Because whoever the nameservers are registered to SHOULD be able to set A records
[08:09:05] <member68> they allow A records for top level domain. that's why i wanted to set up freedns. but they refuse it because of some error
[08:09:40] <Hogofwar> member68, and freedns wants you to put their nameservers in?
[08:09:54] <member68> yes
[08:10:07] <danopia> <member68> i have a domain but my hoster won't let me assign an A recored leading to an external host
[08:10:11] <danopia> .....
[08:10:37] <member68> i get 2x error 118: Inconsistent set of NS RRs (IP, NS host names), 1x error 110: Retry value out of range (expected, found)
[08:10:48] <member68> whatever that means
[08:11:01] <danopia> i'd transfer that domain out
[08:11:06] <Hogofwar> Yeah
[08:11:10] <Hogofwar> I recommend NameCheap
[08:11:11] <danopia> if that's intential
[08:11:13] <Hogofwar> They are good
[08:11:17] <danopia> ask tech support, if any
[08:12:04] <member68> what are my dns options with namecheap?
[08:12:16] <Hogofwar> as in setting nameservers?
[08:12:20] <Hogofwar> pretty much anything
[08:12:42] <member68> can i do the above scenario? top level points to my server, sub domain to external server
[08:12:48] <Hogofwar> Yep
[08:12:56] <Hogofwar> AT least
[08:13:01] <Hogofwar> I may not be understanding you
[08:13:03] ### markerz| has quit the server. (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[08:13:06] ### markerz has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[08:13:14] <Hogofwar> Let me detail what i think setting A records are:
[08:13:17] <Hogofwar> You have a domain
[08:13:25] <Hogofwar> You set the nameservers to the host of your website
[08:13:37] <Hogofwar> On the host of your website you are supposed to set the A records
[08:13:54] <member68> redditandroiddevelopers.com should point to my server, dev.redditandroiddevelopers.com should point to wjoe's redmine server
[08:14:14] <Hogofwar> member68, does your HOST support setting A records
[08:14:37] <member68> yes, but only for top level domains (e.g. redditandroiddevelopers.com)
[08:14:46] <Hogofwar> So it's your host that's the problem?
[08:14:50] <member68> yes
[08:15:09] <Hogofwar> I was thinking it was your domain registrar
[08:15:14] <Hogofwar> Well, you need a new host then
[08:15:26] <Hogofwar> Namecheap just registers doman names
[08:15:29] <Hogofwar> *domain
[08:15:35] <member68> hoster and domain registrar are the same person in my case. it's a hosting package + 4 domains
[08:15:39] <Hogofwar> ah
[08:15:50] <Hogofwar> So, can your nameservers be changed
[08:16:02] <member68> yes, i can do that
[08:16:16] <Hogofwar> And it allows the freedns in the nameservers?
[08:16:38] <member68> nope, that's where i the errors i posted above
[08:16:49] <Hogofwar> okay
[08:16:55] <Hogofwar> that sounds like a domain problem
[08:17:04] <member68> i created a ticket with tech support, they told me the dns wasn't properly configured
[08:17:05] <Hogofwar> First, i recommend talking to tech support
[08:17:14] <Hogofwar> okay
[08:17:30] <Hogofwar> So it might be freedns that is the problem?
[08:18:11] ### Raion has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[08:18:18] <member68> maybe. i don't know enough about configuring dns servers to judge on that
[08:18:47] <Hogofwar> try setting the dns servers to ns2.hostingreborn.com
[08:18:49] <Hogofwar> and ns3
[08:18:57] <Hogofwar> It won't do anything, just maybe it will allow you
[08:19:26] <Hogofwar> Though on second thought it is a stupid idea
[08:19:44] <Hogofwar> member68, so your host doesn't allow you to do what on the host?
[08:19:51] <Hogofwar> What do you mean b arecords only for TLDs?
[08:19:56] <Hogofwar> *a records
[08:21:04] <Hogofwar> member68, does the host use something like CPANEL?
[08:23:21] ### RAWR has quit the server. (Quit: Leaving)
[08:23:51] <member68> no cpanel. just a complicated web interface
[08:23:59] <member68> looks custom built
[08:24:15] <member68> i need a new hoster + new domain
[08:24:24] <Hogofwar> so, what do you mean you are limited by what the A records are set to?
[08:24:26] <member68> *new domain registar
[08:26:57] <Hogofwar> member68, and can I have a screenie of your A record input page?
[08:27:17] <member68> hold on
[08:31:38] <member68> it's all in german, sorry about that. i hope you can figure out the words using leo or the context

[08:32:28] <member68> i'm testing on my personal domain btw. didn't want redditandroiddevelopers to go down for some reason
[08:32:58] ### markerz| has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[08:32:58] ### markerz has quit the server. (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[08:33:35] <danopia> anything that takes URLs and paths as the target of a subdomain is NOT what you want
[08:33:59] <member68> that's the only option my hoster presents to me
[08:34:15] <Hogofwar> shit hoster
[08:34:18] <danopia> so you're trying afraid?
[08:34:41] <member68> any alternatives to hosting with them? i don't really care anymore if i have to change hosters
[08:34:57] <Hogofwar> member68, I use Hostingreborn
[08:35:08] <Hogofwar> It's pay as you go and can be quite cheap with small amounts of traffic
[08:35:25] <Hogofwar> Ituses cpanel so you get the A record adder: http://i.imgur.com/NwIxB.png
[08:36:23] <Hogofwar> I also use namecheap for my domain
[08:36:33] <Hogofwar> Their transfer is quite easy
[08:36:47] <Hogofwar> it costs a tiny bit but by no means a fortune
[08:36:54] <Hogofwar> danopia, what are cnames for anyway
[08:37:21] <member68> is hostingreborn just domain registrar or do they provide hosting too? if they offer hosting, what kind of servers do they provide? i'd like to have java on there if possible
[08:37:30] <danopia> Hogofwar, this: http://i.imgur.com/jibIf.png
[08:37:37] <Hogofwar> member68, only hosting
[08:37:46] <danopia> basically if you use lots of cloud hosts and dyndns, you'll use cnames
[08:37:57] <danopia> i only use A's at the root because that's required by the DNS system
[08:38:02] <Hogofwar> danopia, do you use namcheap as hosting?
[08:38:13] <danopia> only for a domain
[08:38:20] <danopia> i don't pay for anything except the domain
[08:38:32] <Hogofwar> where the hell is that menu then
[08:38:36] <Hogofwar> I havent' seen it before
[08:38:46] <danopia> "All Host Records" under manage domain
[08:38:47] <member68> namcheap looks good for my domain name. I'll look into hosting in a few minutes after calling my current hoster
[08:38:49] <Hogofwar> member68, redditandroiddevelopers.com cannot be transfered
[08:38:49] <Hogofwar> This domain is not yet 60 days old
[08:39:00] <danopia> Home > My Account > Manage Domains > Modify Domain
[08:39:05] <member68> damn it
[08:39:29] <danopia> member68, i saw you using afraiddns in the panel
[08:39:33] <danopia> how'd that work?
[08:39:46] <Hogofwar> danopia, where is modify domain
[08:39:58] <member68> first it said "in progress", then it reverted back to the 1blu-dns server
[08:40:30] <danopia> Hogofwar, when i log in there's "ACCOUNT INFORMATION"
[08:40:33] <danopia> and it has a list of things
[08:40:42] <danopia> first thing: "Number of domains in your account: 1"
[08:40:48] <danopia> i click "view" next to that
[08:40:56] <Hogofwar> okay
[08:40:57] <danopia> theck click hte domain
[08:41:09] <Hogofwar> Yes?
[08:41:18] <danopia> and then you're in the manage domains part
[08:41:29] <Hogofwar> nothing about A records
[08:41:31] <danopia> hah, i transfered on 1/1/12 ^.^
[08:41:43] <danopia> Hogofwar, "All Host Records" on the left
[08:41:51] <Hogofwar> danopia, not there
[08:42:03] <danopia> do you use namecheap's DNS?
[08:42:07] <Hogofwar> no
[08:42:09] <member68> ticket said to go to the denic website (they manage all .de domains) and check for errors, that resulted in 3 errors
[08:42:12] <danopia> ....that's why
[08:42:14] <Hogofwar> heh
[08:42:48] <Hogofwar> so what's the real use of using CNAMES instead of A records?
[08:42:57] <member68> but i just got an idea. by any chance. can the problem be related to the fact that freedns manages .com adresses and i tried using a .de adress?
[08:43:03] <danopia> they're aliases
[08:43:17] <danopia> Hogofwar, why would you symlink something instead of copying it?
[08:43:35] <Hogofwar> because it only needs to be in one place?
[08:43:52] <danopia> so what if google changes an IP of one of their frontends?
[08:43:55] <Hogofwar> and for the computer to act like it's in another?
[08:44:08] <danopia> then my blog would randomly load slowly as the old IP was picked
[08:44:13] <Hogofwar> ah, so it redirects to whatever
[08:44:14] <danopia> until i uplaoded my list
[08:44:17] <danopia> updated*
[08:44:43] <danopia> yea
[08:44:46] <danopia> it's like a symlink
[08:44:49] <danopia> or an alias
[08:44:54] <danopia> "look up this instead"
[08:45:15] <Hogofwar> so, is it better to use an A record or a CNAME if you want the subdomain to point to a minecraft server, or any other game server?
[08:45:31] <danopia> a CNAME is only useful if an A already exists elsewhere
[08:45:55] <danopia> if the gameserver is on a dynamic IP, i would use a CNAME to a dynip service (there are three such CNAMEs on my domain, in the screenshot)
[08:46:52] <danopia> Hogofwar, my records either point to Heroku, point to Google, or point to my own machines via No-IP
[08:47:26] <Hogofwar> so if there isn't a dynamic IP, there is no need?
[08:47:47] <danopia> not really
[08:48:04] <danopia> unless someone else runs the server and already has a record on their domain
[08:48:08] <danopia> and you're lazy
[08:48:25] <danopia> CNAME it on your domain to their subdomain, so if the IP does happen to change then you wouldn't have to do anythnig
[08:48:31] <danopia> also, much easier if it's a roundrobin
[08:48:48] <danopia> that's common for IRC; irc.ubuntu.com iirc is a CNAME to irc.freenode.net
[08:49:02] <danopia> irc.ubuntu.com.		600	IN	CNAME	chat.freenode.net.
[08:49:02] <danopia> chat.freenode.net.	60	IN	A	174.143.119.91
[08:49:03] <danopia> etc.
