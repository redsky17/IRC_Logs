[00:00:05] <ballpointcarrot> Sanit has taken point for the most part; put together the inital github repo. It was forked to the RAD org, and looks like there's an issue and a pull request waiting.

[00:08:00] <Sanit> not working fully, I'm fairly tired so I will have a look at it tomorrow if no one fixes it while I'm away.
[00:08:01] <jaimeh> Sanit did we figure out what a name space for all projects?
[00:08:13] <Sanit> it was either the long one or the short one
[00:08:20] <Sanit> I don't think we decided
[00:08:48] <jaimeh> Tomorrow morning should be better as all the international people should be on.
[00:09:46] <Sanit> international relative to who?
[00:10:15] <jaimeh> I just mean everyone is more likely to be up in 8 hours.
[00:11:34] <Sanit> ah yeah. it's 4:12am where I am now, so I should be back for a short bit in 6 or 7 hours
[00:12:29] <smirk__> hi again

[01:44:05] <joholz> this is Git
[01:44:13] ### markerz has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[01:44:52] <joholz> would solving the problem mean, git push --force?

[01:49:29] <ballpointcarrot> joholz: make sure you've pulled so you have the most up-to-date code in your tree first.
[01:49:47] <ballpointcarrot> chances are, someone pushed between the last time you pulled and your push.
[01:54:20] <joholz> ballointcarrot: thanks

[02:05:55] <smirk> but freenode is the shiz
[02:06:24] <joholz> im doing alright, playing around with git atm
[02:07:10] <joholz> is it possible to write a commit on every file (custom commits for files)
[02:07:45] <smirk> whats that?
[02:08:13] <smirk> git atm?
[02:08:25] <joholz> GitHub at the moment
[02:09:09] <smirk> i cant wait till i get another computer
[02:09:29] <joholz> haha i can tell, what happened to you old one?
[02:09:32] <joholz> just too old?
[02:09:43] <danopia> joholz, what do you mean by "on every file"?
[02:09:48] <smirk> so i can google more easier
[02:09:56] <danopia> you're free to address every file in your message
[02:10:44] <joholz> danopia, so it would be git add Blah.... and then i would just do git commit ?
[02:10:55] <smirk> car hit me n fucked all me and it up
[02:10:57] <danopia> joholz, yes
[02:11:06] <joholz> that would make commit to that file, and do that for all files i want to make custom messages?
[02:11:26] <joholz> smirk: sry to hear that
[02:11:29] <smirk> cussing offensive?
[02:11:45] <smirk> its cool
[02:11:46] <joholz> I am 10 what is this?
[02:12:21] <smirk> im just happy to live
[02:12:38] <joholz> living is cool
[02:12:51] <smirk> broke me legs
[02:13:33] <ballpointcarrot> joholz: you're trying to just commit the changes on one file?
[02:14:09] <smirk> yea im happy to find this dev resource and i cant wait to jump back into programming
[02:14:30] <joholz> ballpointcarrot, well I am just adding a ton of files, and would like to make custom commits to specific files
[02:15:24] <smirk> what ar e commits?
[02:15:30] <joholz> make sense at all?
[02:15:46] <joholz> smirk: messages added to changed files
[02:17:50] <smirk> i cant wait to have the sdk on a machine im pissed about the wreck
[02:18:47] <smirk> i woulnt have found this place i suppose

[02:19:57] <smirk> messages?like a comment section in a file attributes?
[02:20:17] ### MooseEh has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[02:23:15] <smirk> sorry if it seems stupid of me to be asking. im on a wii and if i google i loose channel window
[02:23:57] <ballpointcarrot> smirk: a commit is a list of changes submitted to a git repo.
[02:24:54] <joholz> smirk: the commit helps other users who are looking at the project understand what you changed, by only taking a quick glance
[02:25:28] <joholz> smirk: what games you got for wii?
[02:26:53] <smirk> shit im gonna have to wait for my computer. i wont ask no more newb q's. hope its cool if i still kick back. i eventually will participate and not be so lame
[02:27:44] <joholz> feel free to ask q's
[02:28:15] <smirk> mario kart n wii sports... its my moms.. shes kinda helping me while im hurt
[02:29:03] <joholz> did you hack the wii yet?
[02:29:17] <smirk> whats a git repo ?
[02:29:58] <ballpointcarrot> git is a source code management system. repo is short for repository (where the code goes)
[02:30:11] <smirk> you mean for pirated games?
[02:30:30] <ballpointcarrot> nope.
[02:30:45] <ThatPlayer> I think he was talking to joholz =P
[02:31:06] <ballpointcarrot> no, I'm just confused at this point. :)
[02:31:21] <joholz> lol me too
[02:31:27] <ThatPlayer> Well I could be wrong, I'm constantly distracted =)
[02:31:31] <smirk> so what he wants to do with file is for programmer and not an actual user yet?
[02:32:42] <smirk> im not confused at all :p
[02:33:07] <ballpointcarrot> smirk's "you mean for pirated games?" I interpreted as talking about git (hence, 'Nope.') he was actually talking about the wii hacking.
[02:34:02] <joholz> lol no necessarily for pirated games... theme change, flow covers, dvd player
[02:34:10] <ThatPlayer> But who does that? =P
[02:34:42] <smirk> only thing i hacked with a wii is myself up into a freenode channel
[02:34:49] <joholz> lolz, well of course you can BACKUP your games
[02:35:12] <ThatPlayer> Well it loads faster off a USB than disc
[02:35:35] <smirk> lol@ backup games
[02:35:38] <joholz> my hacked wii is screwing up playing sports resort, i need to fix that
[02:36:09] <smirk> oh i got sports resort too

[02:48:06] <smirk> its been a long time since i was on a dev team
[02:48:57] <ThatPlayer> joholz: Does that add the file? Doesn't seem like it commits it
[02:49:07] <joholz> git commit -m "myfile1 commit" .............. git add .   ................ git commit ...............git push -u origin master
[02:49:27] <ThatPlayer> smirk: Me too =)
[02:49:44] <smirk> use to write password crackers and staff account tools for stolen aol account activity

[02:54:20] <smirk> i was hit by a car i broke my legs and my lappy
[02:54:38] <smirk> might just need a screen
[02:55:23] <smirk> it beeps once when i turn on a dell inspiron
