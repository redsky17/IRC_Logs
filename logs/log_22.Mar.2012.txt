[00:00:05] <ballpointcarrot> Sanit has taken point for the most part; put together the inital github repo. It was forked to the RAD org, and looks like there's an issue and a pull request waiting.

[00:08:00] <Sanit> not working fully, I'm fairly tired so I will have a look at it tomorrow if no one fixes it while I'm away.
[00:08:01] <jaimeh> Sanit did we figure out what a name space for all projects?
[00:08:13] <Sanit> it was either the long one or the short one
[00:08:20] <Sanit> I don't think we decided
[00:08:48] <jaimeh> Tomorrow morning should be better as all the international people should be on.
[00:09:46] <Sanit> international relative to who?
[00:10:15] <jaimeh> I just mean everyone is more likely to be up in 8 hours.
[00:11:34] <Sanit> ah yeah. it's 4:12am where I am now, so I should be back for a short bit in 6 or 7 hours

[01:44:05] <joholz> this is Git
[01:44:13] ### markerz has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[01:44:52] <joholz> would solving the problem mean, git push --force?

[01:49:29] <ballpointcarrot> joholz: make sure you've pulled so you have the most up-to-date code in your tree first.
[01:49:47] <ballpointcarrot> chances are, someone pushed between the last time you pulled and your push.
[01:54:20] <joholz> ballointcarrot: thanks
