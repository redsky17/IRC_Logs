[00:00:05] <ballpointcarrot> Sanit has taken point for the most part; put together the inital github repo. It was forked to the RAD org, and looks like there's an issue and a pull request waiting.

[00:08:00] <Sanit> not working fully, I'm fairly tired so I will have a look at it tomorrow if no one fixes it while I'm away.
[00:08:01] <jaimeh> Sanit did we figure out what a name space for all projects?
[00:08:13] <Sanit> it was either the long one or the short one
[00:08:20] <Sanit> I don't think we decided
[00:08:48] <jaimeh> Tomorrow morning should be better as all the international people should be on.
[00:09:46] <Sanit> international relative to who?
[00:10:15] <jaimeh> I just mean everyone is more likely to be up in 8 hours.
[00:11:34] <Sanit> ah yeah. it's 4:12am where I am now, so I should be back for a short bit in 6 or 7 hours

[01:49:29] <ballpointcarrot> joholz: make sure you've pulled so you have the most up-to-date code in your tree first.
[01:49:47] <ballpointcarrot> chances are, someone pushed between the last time you pulled and your push.

[02:05:55] <smirk> but freenode is the shiz
[02:06:24] <joholz> im doing alright, playing around with git atm
[02:07:10] <joholz> is it possible to write a commit on every file (custom commits for files)
[02:07:45] <smirk> whats that?
[02:08:13] <smirk> git atm?
[02:08:25] <joholz> GitHub at the moment
[02:09:09] <smirk> i cant wait till i get another computer
[02:09:29] <joholz> haha i can tell, what happened to you old one?
[02:09:32] <joholz> just too old?
[02:09:43] <danopia> joholz, what do you mean by "on every file"?
[02:09:48] <smirk> so i can google more easier
[02:09:56] <danopia> you're free to address every file in your message
[02:10:44] <joholz> danopia, so it would be git add Blah.... and then i would just do git commit ?
[02:10:55] <smirk> car hit me n fucked all me and it up
[02:10:57] <danopia> joholz, yes
[02:11:06] <joholz> that would make commit to that file, and do that for all files i want to make custom messages?
[02:11:26] <joholz> smirk: sry to hear that
[02:11:29] <smirk> cussing offensive?
[02:11:45] <smirk> its cool
[02:11:46] <joholz> I am 10 what is this?
[02:12:21] <smirk> im just happy to live

[02:12:51] <smirk> broke me legs
[02:13:33] <ballpointcarrot> joholz: you're trying to just commit the changes on one file?
[02:14:09] <smirk> yea im happy to find this dev resource and i cant wait to jump back into programming
[02:14:30] <joholz> ballpointcarrot, well I am just adding a ton of files, and would like to make custom commits to specific files
[02:15:24] <smirk> what ar e commits?

[02:23:15] <smirk> sorry if it seems stupid of me to be asking. im on a wii and if i google i loose channel window
[02:23:57] <ballpointcarrot> smirk: a commit is a list of changes submitted to a git repo.
[02:24:54] <joholz> smirk: the commit helps other users who are looking at the project understand what you changed, by only taking a quick glance
[02:25:28] <joholz> smirk: what games you got for wii?
[02:26:53] <smirk> shit im gonna have to wait for my computer. i wont ask no more newb q's. hope its cool if i still kick back. i eventually will participate and not be so lame
[02:27:44] <joholz> feel free to ask q's
[02:28:15] <smirk> mario kart n wii sports... its my moms.. shes kinda helping me while im hurt
[02:29:03] <joholz> did you hack the wii yet?
[02:29:17] <smirk> whats a git repo ?
[02:29:58] <ballpointcarrot> git is a source code management system. repo is short for repository (where the code goes)
[02:30:11] <smirk> you mean for pirated games?
[02:30:30] <ballpointcarrot> nope.
[02:30:45] <ThatPlayer> I think he was talking to joholz =P
[02:31:06] <ballpointcarrot> no, I'm just confused at this point. :)
[02:31:21] <joholz> lol me too
[02:31:27] <ThatPlayer> Well I could be wrong, I'm constantly distracted =)
[02:31:31] <smirk> so what he wants to do with file is for programmer and not an actual user yet?
[02:32:42] <smirk> im not confused at all :p
[02:33:07] <ballpointcarrot> smirk's "you mean for pirated games?" I interpreted as talking about git (hence, 'Nope.') he was actually talking about the wii hacking.
[02:34:02] <joholz> lol no necessarily for pirated games... theme change, flow covers, dvd player
[02:34:10] <ThatPlayer> But who does that? =P
[02:34:42] <smirk> only thing i hacked with a wii is myself up into a freenode channel
[02:34:49] <joholz> lolz, well of course you can BACKUP your games
[02:35:12] <ThatPlayer> Well it loads faster off a USB than disc
[02:35:35] <smirk> lol@ backup games
[02:35:38] <joholz> my hacked wii is screwing up playing sports resort, i need to fix that
[02:36:09] <smirk> oh i got sports resort too

[03:14:47] <joholz> although all the commits seem to be hitting: https://github.com/Joholz/TestGit/commits/master
[03:15:00] <smirk> you blaze it?

[03:18:04] <smirk_> so you party or what player?
[03:18:28] <joholz> the commits you see in my commit history...shouldnt they be showing in the repo home page as messages?
[03:19:06] <adamell> joholz: you don't really ever commit one file. you can, but when you command it to commit it usually figures out what's changed and what hasn't and commits only the necessary files for you anyway
[03:19:19] <smirk_> n/m

[03:20:09] <adamell> joholz: which repo are you talking about?
[03:20:20] <joholz> https://github.com/Joholz/TestGit
[03:20:55] <smirk_> commits are associated with online files? not files at the machine?
[03:21:17] <joholz> i do git add "specific file or whatever" .... git commit -m "this is the specific file or whatever" ... git push origin master
[03:21:23] <adamell> They're all there up to 10 minutes ago
[03:21:34] <member68> smirk: please read our wiki at http://rad.lc8n.com/projects/general-organization/wiki
[03:22:04] <joholz> but the messages are 2 hours ago. the "test commit for git"
[03:22:16] <member68> this might help you understand a lot of the terms we use a whole lot better
[03:22:43] <adamell> oh you mean on the front page? not the commit history page?
[03:22:52] <member68> joholz: walk me through your workflow real quick
[03:23:04] <smirk_> i will soon as i get me puter running again. i cant even sign up to that site from my wii
[03:23:42] <c0smic> smirk_: You don't need to sign up for it, just browse the wiki for answers
[03:23:47] <adamell> joholz: go to terminal (if on mac) and type 'git status'
[03:23:48] <joholz> hold on, im getting a pastebin setup
[03:24:03] <smirk_> someone said i could ask q's when i apollogized for newb questions

[03:29:56] <adamell> *$ git status
[03:30:12] <adamell> or just paste it here, it shouldn't be more than one line
[03:30:32] <member68> try using "git commit -a"
[03:30:42] <member68> that adds all changed files

[03:30:48] <smirk_> yall have a good night ima watch some movies on netflix. see yall in the morning
[03:30:54] <joholz> yea its telling me to use git commit -a
[03:31:19] <adamell> yeah. git status usually points you in the right direction
[03:32:03] <joholz> right after file delete, "branch is ahead of origin/master by 1 commit"

[03:37:38] <ballpointcarrot> since git questions have been a common event tonight, I highly recommend taking a look at this: http://book.git-scm.com/index.html
[03:37:46] <ballpointcarrot> also, if anyone has questions, I'll be willing to answer them.
[03:37:48] <member68> sure, go ahead. anybody can add their suggestions

[04:41:26] <Archelaus> \o/
[04:43:14] <Archelaus> I was wondering how I would go about getting into one of the many teams you guys have goin'
[04:44:34] ### RAWR has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[04:44:41] <adamell> Send a $50 made out to C.A.S.H. and send it to the prince of Nigeria
[04:45:15] ### anjoyed is now known as prince_of_nigeri
[04:45:39] <Archelaus> unfortunately i do not fall for that
[04:45:50] <prince_of_nigeri> nuts
[04:45:52] <Archelaus> not to brag, i did get an email from the queen of tibet
[04:45:54] <adamell> lol
[04:46:07] ### prince_of_nigeri is now known as anjoyed
[04:46:21] <member68> do we still need the alpha project on github?
[04:46:22] <Archelaus> she needs 1,000 pounds to feed the hungry and will pay me back as soon as she can
[04:47:30] <member68> Archelaus: click on the project and you should see a sign up link on the right
[04:48:06] <Archelaus> https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dHFNdllONnVlMWNnQ095M0VaRkxBMFE6MQ ?
[04:48:28] <Archelaus> ensure I have the correct part, the amount of times I've accidentally signed up for gmail is redic ;) ;P
[04:48:35] <Archelaus> ensuring*
[04:48:43] <member68> try dev.redditandroiddevelopers.com
[04:48:50] <member68> http://dev.redditandroiddevelopers.com
[04:49:23] ### deliwien has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[04:49:31] <Archelaus> Ah, redmine, this is something I've very much so familiar with
[04:50:51] <member68> I'll remember that if I run into problems ;)
[04:52:26] <anjoyed> don't think the alpha is necessary any more really
[04:53:08] <anjoyed> well
[04:53:22] <anjoyed> is it still the only repo hooked up to redmine?
[04:53:53] <adamell> Reddit-Quick-Submit is too
[04:54:05] <anyonethinkingab> member68:  have you started any other projects since the release of the poll results 10 hours ago?
[04:55:04] <member68> anjoyed: yes. I'll get to that later.

[04:55:10] ### markerz has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[04:55:21] <member68> anyonethinkingab: to redmine or to github?
[04:55:32] <anyonethinkingab> both
[04:56:12] <member68> redmine, i don't think so, github, yes, just a few minutes ago
[04:56:41] <anyonethinkingab> is the calculator a project?
[04:57:03] <anyonethinkingab> or just something to learn from?
[04:57:35] <member68> it's a project for beginners
[04:57:54] <member68> everybody can work on it, but it won't be collaborative
[04:58:00] <anyonethinkingab> oh ok
[04:58:08] <anyonethinkingab> so it's not actually a project
[04:59:03] <member68> i added it so that people can join it and start discussions if they need help. but it's not something that will be worked on together
[04:59:14] <anyonethinkingab> should i begin contacting the PM's, or do you think the current amount of project is alright?
[05:00:03] <anyonethinkingab> or will you do that?
[05:00:13] <member68> i think it's a good start. we can add projects anytime anyway
[05:00:26] <member68> why do you want to contact the PMs?
[05:00:43] <anyonethinkingab> ok. I just don't have the feeling that they know they can/should start
[05:00:55] <anyonethinkingab> because i can't really do much elso for the moment
[05:01:04] <member68> problem is: we don't have gerrit set up yet
[05:01:04] <anyonethinkingab> and i want to be involved
[05:01:08] <anyonethinkingab> oh
[05:01:20] <member68> so for now, we can only do planning but no actual coding
[05:01:26] <anyonethinkingab> kk
[05:01:48] <anyonethinkingab> I'll pm them on reddit throughout the day
[05:02:36] <c0smic> member68: Who is setting up gerrit?
[05:02:45] <member68> wjoe
[05:03:02] <anyonethinkingab> right now or...?
[05:03:31] <c0smic> Gotcha
[05:03:38] <member68> haven't talked to him yet today. i asked him quite often yesterday and don't want to piss him off
[05:03:49] <c0smic> anyonethinkingab: He's started it, not sure if he's working now
[05:03:55] <anyonethinkingab> oh ok
[05:03:59] <member68> yesterday he sais something about getting it done today
[05:07:38] <member68> i updated the github info page at http://redditandroiddev.github.com
[05:08:02] <member68> it's just cosmetics but it's better than an empty html file
[05:09:41] <anyonethinkingab> haha i just noticed this in the results
[05:09:58] <adamell> Oh you have the g-tasks repo  up too
[05:10:14] <anyonethinkingab> Mobile Reddit app got 34 % of the public votes, but only 14% from PMS
[05:10:47] <anyonethinkingab> while "Reddit Client" got only 25% from the public but did get 27% from PMS
[05:12:13] <member68> might have something to do with the order in which apps were show. also as a PM voting for an app includes a bigger commitment than for a developer. developers can do multiple apps, PMs will probably do 1-2 projects only
[05:12:27] <anyonethinkingab> hmm yes
[05:12:36] <anyonethinkingab> unlike you lol
[05:12:41] ### alextsc has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[05:12:50] <anyonethinkingab> 4 projects
[05:13:43] <member68> i'll pitch in whereever i can help. don't know if i will really be a PM or if I can direct that to somebody else who has more time
[05:14:01] <member68> organzing everything takes up a lot of time right now
[05:14:12] <member68> maybe it'll get better with time ;)
[05:14:17] <adamell> Where's the submission description for the g-task-client app?
[05:14:23] <anyonethinkingab> should i add to the spreadsheet that a PM is still needed?
[05:14:41] <member68> sure
[05:14:44] <anyonethinkingab> k

[05:15:00] <member68> i didn't add a description yet because I couldn't come up with one last night
[05:17:22] <adamell> We'll if it's what I think it is and there are the proper API's available I'll PM it.
[05:17:39] <adamell> I remember trying to create a google reader API once open source
[05:17:42] <adamell> it was hell
[05:17:47] <adamell> and it never really got going
[05:18:09] <adamell> too many bugs because google kept updating everything to it
[05:18:37] <adamell> then they eventually made their own API.
[05:18:50] <anjoyed> added a bit more info to the mylyn page
