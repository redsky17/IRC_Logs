[00:00:05] <ballpointcarrot> Sanit has taken point for the most part; put together the inital github repo. It was forked to the RAD org, and looks like there's an issue and a pull request waiting.

[00:08:00] <Sanit> not working fully, I'm fairly tired so I will have a look at it tomorrow if no one fixes it while I'm away.
[00:08:01] <jaimeh> Sanit did we figure out what a name space for all projects?
[00:08:13] <Sanit> it was either the long one or the short one
[00:08:20] <Sanit> I don't think we decided
[00:08:48] <jaimeh> Tomorrow morning should be better as all the international people should be on.
[00:09:46] <Sanit> international relative to who?
[00:10:15] <jaimeh> I just mean everyone is more likely to be up in 8 hours.
[00:11:34] <Sanit> ah yeah. it's 4:12am where I am now, so I should be back for a short bit in 6 or 7 hours

[01:49:29] <ballpointcarrot> joholz: make sure you've pulled so you have the most up-to-date code in your tree first.
[01:49:47] <ballpointcarrot> chances are, someone pushed between the last time you pulled and your push.

[02:05:55] <smirk> but freenode is the shiz
[02:06:24] <joholz> im doing alright, playing around with git atm
[02:07:10] <joholz> is it possible to write a commit on every file (custom commits for files)
[02:07:45] <smirk> whats that?
[02:08:13] <smirk> git atm?
[02:08:25] <joholz> GitHub at the moment
[02:09:09] <smirk> i cant wait till i get another computer
[02:09:29] <joholz> haha i can tell, what happened to you old one?
[02:09:32] <joholz> just too old?
[02:09:43] <danopia> joholz, what do you mean by "on every file"?
[02:09:48] <smirk> so i can google more easier
[02:09:56] <danopia> you're free to address every file in your message
[02:10:44] <joholz> danopia, so it would be git add Blah.... and then i would just do git commit ?
[02:10:55] <smirk> car hit me n fucked all me and it up
[02:10:57] <danopia> joholz, yes
[02:11:06] <joholz> that would make commit to that file, and do that for all files i want to make custom messages?
[02:11:26] <joholz> smirk: sry to hear that
[02:11:29] <smirk> cussing offensive?
[02:11:45] <smirk> its cool
[02:11:46] <joholz> I am 10 what is this?
[02:12:21] <smirk> im just happy to live

[02:12:51] <smirk> broke me legs
[02:13:33] <ballpointcarrot> joholz: you're trying to just commit the changes on one file?
[02:14:09] <smirk> yea im happy to find this dev resource and i cant wait to jump back into programming
[02:14:30] <joholz> ballpointcarrot, well I am just adding a ton of files, and would like to make custom commits to specific files
[02:15:24] <smirk> what ar e commits?

[02:23:15] <smirk> sorry if it seems stupid of me to be asking. im on a wii and if i google i loose channel window
[02:23:57] <ballpointcarrot> smirk: a commit is a list of changes submitted to a git repo.
[02:24:54] <joholz> smirk: the commit helps other users who are looking at the project understand what you changed, by only taking a quick glance
[02:25:28] <joholz> smirk: what games you got for wii?
[02:26:53] <smirk> shit im gonna have to wait for my computer. i wont ask no more newb q's. hope its cool if i still kick back. i eventually will participate and not be so lame
[02:27:44] <joholz> feel free to ask q's
[02:28:15] <smirk> mario kart n wii sports... its my moms.. shes kinda helping me while im hurt
[02:29:03] <joholz> did you hack the wii yet?
[02:29:17] <smirk> whats a git repo ?
[02:29:58] <ballpointcarrot> git is a source code management system. repo is short for repository (where the code goes)
[02:30:11] <smirk> you mean for pirated games?
[02:30:30] <ballpointcarrot> nope.
[02:30:45] <ThatPlayer> I think he was talking to joholz =P
[02:31:06] <ballpointcarrot> no, I'm just confused at this point. :)
[02:31:21] <joholz> lol me too
[02:31:27] <ThatPlayer> Well I could be wrong, I'm constantly distracted =)
[02:31:31] <smirk> so what he wants to do with file is for programmer and not an actual user yet?
[02:32:42] <smirk> im not confused at all :p
[02:33:07] <ballpointcarrot> smirk's "you mean for pirated games?" I interpreted as talking about git (hence, 'Nope.') he was actually talking about the wii hacking.
[02:34:02] <joholz> lol no necessarily for pirated games... theme change, flow covers, dvd player
[02:34:10] <ThatPlayer> But who does that? =P
[02:34:42] <smirk> only thing i hacked with a wii is myself up into a freenode channel
[02:34:49] <joholz> lolz, well of course you can BACKUP your games
[02:35:12] <ThatPlayer> Well it loads faster off a USB than disc
[02:35:35] <smirk> lol@ backup games
[02:35:38] <joholz> my hacked wii is screwing up playing sports resort, i need to fix that
[02:36:09] <smirk> oh i got sports resort too

[03:14:47] <joholz> although all the commits seem to be hitting: https://github.com/Joholz/TestGit/commits/master
[03:15:00] <smirk> you blaze it?

[03:18:04] <smirk_> so you party or what player?
[03:18:28] <joholz> the commits you see in my commit history...shouldnt they be showing in the repo home page as messages?
[03:19:06] <adamell> joholz: you don't really ever commit one file. you can, but when you command it to commit it usually figures out what's changed and what hasn't and commits only the necessary files for you anyway
[03:19:19] <smirk_> n/m

[03:20:09] <adamell> joholz: which repo are you talking about?
[03:20:20] <joholz> https://github.com/Joholz/TestGit
[03:20:55] <smirk_> commits are associated with online files? not files at the machine?
[03:21:17] <joholz> i do git add "specific file or whatever" .... git commit -m "this is the specific file or whatever" ... git push origin master
[03:21:23] <adamell> They're all there up to 10 minutes ago
[03:21:34] <member68> smirk: please read our wiki at http://rad.lc8n.com/projects/general-organization/wiki
[03:22:04] <joholz> but the messages are 2 hours ago. the "test commit for git"
[03:22:16] <member68> this might help you understand a lot of the terms we use a whole lot better
[03:22:43] <adamell> oh you mean on the front page? not the commit history page?
[03:22:52] <member68> joholz: walk me through your workflow real quick
[03:23:04] <smirk_> i will soon as i get me puter running again. i cant even sign up to that site from my wii
[03:23:42] <c0smic> smirk_: You don't need to sign up for it, just browse the wiki for answers
[03:23:47] <adamell> joholz: go to terminal (if on mac) and type 'git status'
[03:23:48] <joholz> hold on, im getting a pastebin setup
[03:24:03] <smirk_> someone said i could ask q's when i apollogized for newb questions

[03:29:56] <adamell> *$ git status
[03:30:12] <adamell> or just paste it here, it shouldn't be more than one line
[03:30:32] <member68> try using "git commit -a"
[03:30:42] <member68> that adds all changed files

[03:30:48] <smirk_> yall have a good night ima watch some movies on netflix. see yall in the morning
[03:30:54] <joholz> yea its telling me to use git commit -a
[03:31:19] <adamell> yeah. git status usually points you in the right direction
[03:32:03] <joholz> right after file delete, "branch is ahead of origin/master by 1 commit"

[03:37:38] <ballpointcarrot> since git questions have been a common event tonight, I highly recommend taking a look at this: http://book.git-scm.com/index.html
[03:37:46] <ballpointcarrot> also, if anyone has questions, I'll be willing to answer them.
[03:37:48] <member68> sure, go ahead. anybody can add their suggestions

[04:43:14] <Archelaus> I was wondering how I would go about getting into one of the many teams you guys have goin'
[04:44:34] ### RAWR has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[04:44:41] <adamell> Send a $50 made out to C.A.S.H. and send it to the prince of Nigeria
[04:45:15] ### anjoyed is now known as prince_of_nigeri
[04:45:39] <Archelaus> unfortunately i do not fall for that
[04:45:50] <prince_of_nigeri> nuts
[04:45:52] <Archelaus> not to brag, i did get an email from the queen of tibet
[04:45:54] <adamell> lol
[04:46:07] ### prince_of_nigeri is now known as anjoyed
[04:46:21] <member68> do we still need the alpha project on github?
[04:46:22] <Archelaus> she needs 1,000 pounds to feed the hungry and will pay me back as soon as she can
[04:47:30] <member68> Archelaus: click on the project and you should see a sign up link on the right
[04:48:06] <Archelaus> https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dHFNdllONnVlMWNnQ095M0VaRkxBMFE6MQ ?
[04:48:28] <Archelaus> ensure I have the correct part, the amount of times I've accidentally signed up for gmail is redic ;) ;P

[04:49:31] <Archelaus> Ah, redmine, this is something I've very much so familiar with
[04:50:51] <member68> I'll remember that if I run into problems ;)
[04:52:26] <anjoyed> don't think the alpha is necessary any more really
[04:53:08] <anjoyed> well
[04:53:22] <anjoyed> is it still the only repo hooked up to redmine?
[04:53:53] <adamell> Reddit-Quick-Submit is too
[04:54:05] <anyonethinkingab> member68:  have you started any other projects since the release of the poll results 10 hours ago?
[04:55:04] <member68> anjoyed: yes. I'll get to that later.
[04:55:05] ### markerz| has quit the server. (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[04:55:10] ### markerz has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[04:55:21] <member68> anyonethinkingab: to redmine or to github?
[04:55:32] <anyonethinkingab> both
[04:56:12] <member68> redmine, i don't think so, github, yes, just a few minutes ago
[04:56:41] <anyonethinkingab> is the calculator a project?
[04:57:03] <anyonethinkingab> or just something to learn from?
[04:57:35] <member68> it's a project for beginners
[04:57:54] <member68> everybody can work on it, but it won't be collaborative
[04:58:00] <anyonethinkingab> oh ok
[04:58:08] <anyonethinkingab> so it's not actually a project
[04:59:03] <member68> i added it so that people can join it and start discussions if they need help. but it's not something that will be worked on together
[04:59:14] <anyonethinkingab> should i begin contacting the PM's, or do you think the current amount of project is alright?
[05:00:03] <anyonethinkingab> or will you do that?
[05:00:13] <member68> i think it's a good start. we can add projects anytime anyway
[05:00:26] <member68> why do you want to contact the PMs?
[05:00:43] <anyonethinkingab> ok. I just don't have the feeling that they know they can/should start
[05:00:55] <anyonethinkingab> because i can't really do much elso for the moment
[05:01:04] <member68> problem is: we don't have gerrit set up yet
[05:01:04] <anyonethinkingab> and i want to be involved
[05:01:08] <anyonethinkingab> oh
[05:01:20] <member68> so for now, we can only do planning but no actual coding
[05:01:26] <anyonethinkingab> kk
[05:01:48] <anyonethinkingab> I'll pm them on reddit throughout the day
[05:02:36] <c0smic> member68: Who is setting up gerrit?
[05:02:45] <member68> wjoe
[05:03:02] <anyonethinkingab> right now or...?
[05:03:31] <c0smic> Gotcha
[05:03:38] <member68> haven't talked to him yet today. i asked him quite often yesterday and don't want to piss him off
[05:03:49] <c0smic> anyonethinkingab: He's started it, not sure if he's working now
[05:03:55] <anyonethinkingab> oh ok
[05:03:59] <member68> yesterday he sais something about getting it done today
[05:07:38] <member68> i updated the github info page at http://redditandroiddev.github.com
[05:08:02] <member68> it's just cosmetics but it's better than an empty html file
[05:09:41] <anyonethinkingab> haha i just noticed this in the results
[05:09:58] <adamell> Oh you have the g-tasks repo  up too
[05:10:14] <anyonethinkingab> Mobile Reddit app got 34 % of the public votes, but only 14% from PMS
[05:10:47] <anyonethinkingab> while "Reddit Client" got only 25% from the public but did get 27% from PMS
[05:12:13] <member68> might have something to do with the order in which apps were show. also as a PM voting for an app includes a bigger commitment than for a developer. developers can do multiple apps, PMs will probably do 1-2 projects only
[05:12:27] <anyonethinkingab> hmm yes
[05:12:36] <anyonethinkingab> unlike you lol
[05:12:41] ### alextsc has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[05:12:50] <anyonethinkingab> 4 projects
[05:13:43] <member68> i'll pitch in whereever i can help. don't know if i will really be a PM or if I can direct that to somebody else who has more time
[05:14:01] <member68> organzing everything takes up a lot of time right now
[05:14:12] <member68> maybe it'll get better with time ;)
[05:14:17] <adamell> Where's the submission description for the g-task-client app?
[05:14:23] <anyonethinkingab> should i add to the spreadsheet that a PM is still needed?
[05:14:41] <member68> sure

[05:14:59] ### markerz has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[05:15:00] <member68> i didn't add a description yet because I couldn't come up with one last night
[05:17:22] <adamell> We'll if it's what I think it is and there are the proper API's available I'll PM it.
[05:17:39] <adamell> I remember trying to create a google reader API once open source
[05:17:42] <adamell> it was hell
[05:17:47] <adamell> and it never really got going
[05:18:09] <adamell> too many bugs because google kept updating everything to it
[05:18:37] <adamell> then they eventually made their own API.
[05:18:50] <anjoyed> added a bit more info to the mylyn page
[05:20:17] <member68> thanks
[05:26:40] <adamell> I looked through the reddit submissions for the description of the g-t-app but couldn't find one
[05:27:24] <adamell> Is it just syncing your google tasks (gmail, calendar, etc) to your phone?
[05:28:04] <adamell> There's a Google Tasks API too
[05:28:15] ### Avid has quit the server. (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[05:28:57] <adamell> could you sign me up for PM on rm/gh?
[05:30:52] <adamell> But introducing a new dependency (google api) would require Maven for the devs. I'll get to writing the wiki on it as soon as the RM page is up.
[05:30:58] <member68> added you on rm. github won't have PMs. only admins and gerrit will be able to push code
[05:31:26] <adamell> thanks
[05:32:04] <Archelaus> member68, I'm unsure if you're currently adding developers, but I'd like to be one on the IRC Project for when you are
[05:33:35] <member68> have you created an account on redmine and applied for the project?
[05:33:43] <anyonethinkingab> adamell what are you PM for now?
[05:33:57] <Archelaus> I'm Archelaus on the RM, I'm yes
[05:33:58] <adamell> Kony Liberation Councel

[06:00:21] <anjoyed> haven't heard new album yet, bought soldier after he did an AMA
[06:00:22] <adamell> only you and Kony
[06:00:38] <Hiver> 2012, we're taking it back.
[06:00:50] <member68> i code to cuban music, bueno vista social club and stuff like that ;)
[06:01:14] <member68> besides that jazz, soul and some blues ;)
[06:01:23] <c0smic> I like to code to electronica, like Com Truise: http://soundcloud.com/com-truise
[06:01:36] <Hiver> I dig on BVSC, but they let my mind drift too much. I prefer something driven.
[06:01:57] <adamell> another ghostly fan
[06:02:06] <anjoyed> member68, you tried Manu Chao?
[06:02:17] <adamell> I usually listen to Loscil or Lusine
[06:02:38] <Hiver> C0smic, this would work. Thanks for the link.
[06:02:46] <c0smic> adamell: Nice, I also listen to Mux Mool
[06:02:58] <member68> anjoyed: love them :)
[06:03:03] <c0smic> Hiver: np!
[06:03:10] <anjoyed> good stuff :)
[06:03:58] <member68> problem is while coding i have to focus on text, i can't have music with english or german lyrics
[06:04:26] <c0smic> Same, that's why most of what I listen to is electronica :)
[06:04:36] <anjoyed> aye, usually go for jazz if doing heavy coding. jon coltran type tsuff
[06:04:39] <c0smic> I also like rainymood
[06:05:19] <member68> solo piano music + rainymood ;)
[06:06:06] <c0smic> I should try listening to some Miles Davis or maybe Art Blakey..
[06:06:22] <anjoyed> miles davis is excellent
[06:06:53] <c0smic> Dave Brubeck too
[06:07:06] <c0smic> ahh, so much good music

[06:08:46] <adamell> I was thinking Reddit Android Developers Google Task Client
[06:08:52] <adamell> but it seems lengthy
[06:09:02] <anjoyed> RAD Google Task List?
[06:09:08] <anjoyed> *Client
[06:09:13] <adamell> We also get a logo!
[06:09:52] <adamell> RAD GTL?
[06:09:58] <adamell> no
[06:10:39] <c0smic> RAD Google Tasker?

[06:10:49] <adamell> i like that
[06:11:39] <adamell> Does everybody else?
[06:11:48] <anjoyed> +1
[06:12:41] <adamell> done

[06:22:29] <adamell> what's a google account of yours that I can add to the RAD Google Tasker API access list?
[06:22:32] <Hiver> :) I love it when I go to bed after banging my head against the desk, wake up, write a few lines, and my code suddenly works as expected.
[06:25:37] <ThatPlayer> Sleeping is always good, I'm going tod o taht soon =P

[06:27:14] <anjoyed> John Smith
[06:27:36] <ThatPlayer> I like John Doe better
[06:27:45] <anjoyed> that works too
[06:27:51] <c0smic> ThatPlayer: +1 lol
[06:28:23] <c0smic> I wonder how companies do it?
[06:29:10] <ThatPlayer> I remember getting a Google+ account disabled because I used asdf as my name
[06:29:20] <adamell> lol
[06:29:31] <adamell> \o/
[06:29:51] <ThatPlayer> Yeah, had to update the name and all taht
[06:29:52] <member68> john doe is legal name, so we should be fine
[06:30:08] <adamell> we're only allotted 5,000 queries a day
[06:30:20] <adamell> Let's hope it doesn't get too popular
[06:30:22] <ThatPlayer> Are you setting up a Google Apps account?
[06:30:27] <adamell> Yeah
[06:31:07] <ThatPlayer> Are we going to get a marketplace license thing on the same account?
[06:31:19] <anyonethinkingab> member68:  i sent all the messaged
[06:31:21] <adamell> Not sure
[06:31:33] <member68> great
[06:31:54] <member68> i created redditandroiddevelopers@googlemail.comw
[06:32:08] <member68> we can use it for apis, a market accout, etc

[08:07:14] <member68> i have a domain but my hoster won't let me assign an A recored leading to an external host
[08:07:22] <Hogofwar> that sounds shit
[08:07:36] <Hogofwar> member68, does that mean you are forced to host with them?
[08:07:48] <member68> basically i want to go to dev.redditandroiddevelopers.com and see our redmine
[08:07:58] <member68> my contract expires in autumn
[08:08:02] <member68> i'll change it then
[08:08:25] <Hogofwar> Because whoever the nameservers are registered to SHOULD be able to set A records
[08:09:05] <member68> they allow A records for top level domain. that's why i wanted to set up freedns. but they refuse it because of some error
[08:09:40] <Hogofwar> member68, and freedns wants you to put their nameservers in?
[08:09:54] <member68> yes
[08:10:07] <danopia> <member68> i have a domain but my hoster won't let me assign an A recored leading to an external host
[08:10:11] <danopia> .....
[08:10:37] <member68> i get 2x error 118: Inconsistent set of NS RRs (IP, NS host names), 1x error 110: Retry value out of range (expected, found)
[08:10:48] <member68> whatever that means
[08:11:01] <danopia> i'd transfer that domain out
[08:11:06] <Hogofwar> Yeah
[08:11:10] <Hogofwar> I recommend NameCheap
[08:11:11] <danopia> if that's intential
[08:11:13] <Hogofwar> They are good
[08:11:17] <danopia> ask tech support, if any
[08:12:04] <member68> what are my dns options with namecheap?
[08:12:16] <Hogofwar> as in setting nameservers?
[08:12:20] <Hogofwar> pretty much anything
[08:12:42] <member68> can i do the above scenario? top level points to my server, sub domain to external server
[08:12:48] <Hogofwar> Yep
[08:12:56] <Hogofwar> AT least
[08:13:01] <Hogofwar> I may not be understanding you
[08:13:03] ### markerz| has quit the server. (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[08:13:06] ### markerz has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[08:13:14] <Hogofwar> Let me detail what i think setting A records are:
[08:13:17] <Hogofwar> You have a domain
[08:13:25] <Hogofwar> You set the nameservers to the host of your website
[08:13:37] <Hogofwar> On the host of your website you are supposed to set the A records
[08:13:54] <member68> redditandroiddevelopers.com should point to my server, dev.redditandroiddevelopers.com should point to wjoe's redmine server
[08:14:14] <Hogofwar> member68, does your HOST support setting A records
[08:14:37] <member68> yes, but only for top level domains (e.g. redditandroiddevelopers.com)
[08:14:46] <Hogofwar> So it's your host that's the problem?
[08:14:50] <member68> yes
[08:15:09] <Hogofwar> I was thinking it was your domain registrar
[08:15:14] <Hogofwar> Well, you need a new host then
[08:15:26] <Hogofwar> Namecheap just registers doman names
[08:15:29] <Hogofwar> *domain
[08:15:35] <member68> hoster and domain registrar are the same person in my case. it's a hosting package + 4 domains
[08:15:39] <Hogofwar> ah
[08:15:50] <Hogofwar> So, can your nameservers be changed
[08:16:02] <member68> yes, i can do that
[08:16:16] <Hogofwar> And it allows the freedns in the nameservers?
[08:16:38] <member68> nope, that's where i the errors i posted above
[08:16:49] <Hogofwar> okay
[08:16:55] <Hogofwar> that sounds like a domain problem
[08:17:04] <member68> i created a ticket with tech support, they told me the dns wasn't properly configured
[08:17:05] <Hogofwar> First, i recommend talking to tech support
[08:17:14] <Hogofwar> okay
[08:17:30] <Hogofwar> So it might be freedns that is the problem?
[08:18:11] ### Raion has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[08:18:18] <member68> maybe. i don't know enough about configuring dns servers to judge on that
[08:18:47] <Hogofwar> try setting the dns servers to ns2.hostingreborn.com
[08:18:49] <Hogofwar> and ns3
[08:18:57] <Hogofwar> It won't do anything, just maybe it will allow you
[08:19:26] <Hogofwar> Though on second thought it is a stupid idea
[08:19:44] <Hogofwar> member68, so your host doesn't allow you to do what on the host?
[08:19:51] <Hogofwar> What do you mean b arecords only for TLDs?
[08:19:56] <Hogofwar> *a records
[08:21:04] <Hogofwar> member68, does the host use something like CPANEL?
[08:23:21] ### RAWR has quit the server. (Quit: Leaving)
[08:23:51] <member68> no cpanel. just a complicated web interface
[08:23:59] <member68> looks custom built
[08:24:15] <member68> i need a new hoster + new domain
[08:24:24] <Hogofwar> so, what do you mean you are limited by what the A records are set to?
[08:24:26] <member68> *new domain registar
[08:26:57] <Hogofwar> member68, and can I have a screenie of your A record input page?
[08:27:17] <member68> hold on
[08:31:38] <member68> it's all in german, sorry about that. i hope you can figure out the words using leo or the context

[08:32:58] ### markerz has quit the server. (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[08:33:35] <danopia> anything that takes URLs and paths as the target of a subdomain is NOT what you want
[08:33:59] <member68> that's the only option my hoster presents to me
[08:34:15] <Hogofwar> shit hoster
[08:34:18] <danopia> so you're trying afraid?
[08:34:41] <member68> any alternatives to hosting with them? i don't really care anymore if i have to change hosters
[08:34:57] <Hogofwar> member68, I use Hostingreborn
[08:35:08] <Hogofwar> It's pay as you go and can be quite cheap with small amounts of traffic
[08:35:25] <Hogofwar> Ituses cpanel so you get the A record adder: http://i.imgur.com/NwIxB.png
[08:36:23] <Hogofwar> I also use namecheap for my domain
[08:36:33] <Hogofwar> Their transfer is quite easy
[08:36:47] <Hogofwar> it costs a tiny bit but by no means a fortune
[08:36:54] <Hogofwar> danopia, what are cnames for anyway
[08:37:21] <member68> is hostingreborn just domain registrar or do they provide hosting too? if they offer hosting, what kind of servers do they provide? i'd like to have java on there if possible
[08:37:30] <danopia> Hogofwar, this: http://i.imgur.com/jibIf.png
[08:37:37] <Hogofwar> member68, only hosting
[08:37:46] <danopia> basically if you use lots of cloud hosts and dyndns, you'll use cnames
[08:37:57] <danopia> i only use A's at the root because that's required by the DNS system
[08:38:02] <Hogofwar> danopia, do you use namcheap as hosting?
[08:38:13] <danopia> only for a domain
[08:38:20] <danopia> i don't pay for anything except the domain
[08:38:32] <Hogofwar> where the hell is that menu then
[08:38:36] <Hogofwar> I havent' seen it before
[08:38:46] <danopia> "All Host Records" under manage domain
[08:38:47] <member68> namcheap looks good for my domain name. I'll look into hosting in a few minutes after calling my current hoster
[08:38:49] <Hogofwar> member68, redditandroiddevelopers.com cannot be transfered
[08:38:49] <Hogofwar> This domain is not yet 60 days old
[08:39:00] <danopia> Home > My Account > Manage Domains > Modify Domain
[08:39:05] <member68> damn it
[08:39:29] <danopia> member68, i saw you using afraiddns in the panel
[08:39:33] <danopia> how'd that work?
[08:39:46] <Hogofwar> danopia, where is modify domain
[08:39:58] <member68> first it said "in progress", then it reverted back to the 1blu-dns server
[08:40:30] <danopia> Hogofwar, when i log in there's "ACCOUNT INFORMATION"
[08:40:33] <danopia> and it has a list of things
[08:40:42] <danopia> first thing: "Number of domains in your account: 1"
[08:40:48] <danopia> i click "view" next to that
[08:40:56] <Hogofwar> okay
[08:40:57] <danopia> theck click hte domain
[08:41:09] <Hogofwar> Yes?
[08:41:18] <danopia> and then you're in the manage domains part
[08:41:29] <Hogofwar> nothing about A records
[08:41:31] <danopia> hah, i transfered on 1/1/12 ^.^
[08:41:43] <danopia> Hogofwar, "All Host Records" on the left
[08:41:51] <Hogofwar> danopia, not there
[08:42:03] <danopia> do you use namecheap's DNS?
[08:42:07] <Hogofwar> no
[08:42:09] <member68> ticket said to go to the denic website (they manage all .de domains) and check for errors, that resulted in 3 errors
[08:42:12] <danopia> ....that's why
[08:42:14] <Hogofwar> heh
[08:42:48] <Hogofwar> so what's the real use of using CNAMES instead of A records?
[08:42:57] <member68> but i just got an idea. by any chance. can the problem be related to the fact that freedns manages .com adresses and i tried using a .de adress?
[08:43:03] <danopia> they're aliases
[08:43:17] <danopia> Hogofwar, why would you symlink something instead of copying it?
[08:43:35] <Hogofwar> because it only needs to be in one place?
[08:43:52] <danopia> so what if google changes an IP of one of their frontends?
[08:43:55] <Hogofwar> and for the computer to act like it's in another?
[08:44:08] <danopia> then my blog would randomly load slowly as the old IP was picked
[08:44:13] <Hogofwar> ah, so it redirects to whatever
[08:44:14] <danopia> until i uplaoded my list
[08:44:17] <danopia> updated*
[08:44:43] <danopia> yea
[08:44:46] <danopia> it's like a symlink
[08:44:49] <danopia> or an alias
[08:44:54] <danopia> "look up this instead"
[08:45:15] <Hogofwar> so, is it better to use an A record or a CNAME if you want the subdomain to point to a minecraft server, or any other game server?
[08:45:31] <danopia> a CNAME is only useful if an A already exists elsewhere
[08:45:55] <danopia> if the gameserver is on a dynamic IP, i would use a CNAME to a dynip service (there are three such CNAMEs on my domain, in the screenshot)
[08:46:52] <danopia> Hogofwar, my records either point to Heroku, point to Google, or point to my own machines via No-IP
[08:47:26] <Hogofwar> so if there isn't a dynamic IP, there is no need?
[08:47:47] <danopia> not really
[08:48:04] <danopia> unless someone else runs the server and already has a record on their domain
[08:48:08] <danopia> and you're lazy
[08:48:25] <danopia> CNAME it on your domain to their subdomain, so if the IP does happen to change then you wouldn't have to do anythnig
[08:48:31] <danopia> also, much easier if it's a roundrobin
[08:48:48] <danopia> that's common for IRC; irc.ubuntu.com iirc is a CNAME to irc.freenode.net
[08:49:02] <danopia> irc.ubuntu.com.		600	IN	CNAME	chat.freenode.net.
[08:49:02] <danopia> chat.freenode.net.	60	IN	A	174.143.119.91

[09:06:45] <danopia> you'd pay for it?
[09:06:57] <member68> it's a dollar more than i pay now per month
[09:07:12] <member68> i think i can handle that financialy
[09:07:28] <Hogofwar> can it handle it
[09:07:57] <member68> 1 gig ram, 2 gig ram max, 25gig hdd, no traffic limit, plesk 10 as management software
[09:08:31] <member68> should be enough for 50 users. we don't want to compile code on it so it should be fine i think

[09:33:31] ### RAWR has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[09:33:53] <Sanit> i meant for the collaberation aspect
[09:33:58] <Hogofwar> ooh
[09:34:10] <Hogofwar> A multiplayer notepad app :D
[09:34:42] <Sanit> there is already an IRC project ;-)
[09:34:57] ### itsKitsos has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[09:34:57] <Hogofwar> irc isn't multiplayer notepad though
[09:35:13] <Sanit> so like a google docs app?

[09:35:18] <garychencool> IRC is good enough as it is, I wouldn't want better graphics or whatever
[09:35:19] ### markerz has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[09:35:24] <danopia> you mean like google docs writer?
[09:36:15] <itsKitsos> member68, you there?
[09:38:11] <itsKitsos> Anyway, I have something I'd like to discuss for anyone who would like to provide input
[09:38:16] <member68> yeah
[09:38:32] <itsKitsos> oh good, alright quick question/request
[09:38:44] <itsKitsos> is there oging ot be any type of guideline list for project managers?
[09:38:49] <itsKitsos> to ensure consistent project management
[09:38:55] <itsKitsos> good practices, etc.
[09:39:08] <itsKitsos> just so we dont have 50 different projects being managed completely differently
[09:39:32] <veeti> what do you exactly mean by good practices
[09:40:47] <garychencool> I believe he means to manage the whole projects the same as the same coding style, based on the Android Development Guidelines
[09:40:59] <Hogofwar> oh cool
[09:41:07] <itsKitsos> well if I were to manage a project
[09:41:17] <Hogofwar> member68, planning anything for logbot?
[09:41:20] <itsKitsos> i would have video-based conferences/meetings
[09:41:24] <itsKitsos> like through skype
[09:41:35] <danopia> (or G+)
[09:41:47] <itsKitsos> I'm just wondering how we are going to coordinate (yes G+) consistent management styles
[09:42:07] <itsKitsos> some managers may tend to be more involved with the group
[09:42:10] <member68> hogofwar: automated upload to github when somebody joins?
[09:42:15] <itsKitsos> some might tend to micromanage
[09:42:18] <member68> the general workflow is set by redmine, gerrit and github. but PMs can decide themselves how they want to run their project. i can't tell all PMs how to do their work.
[09:42:21] <Hogofwar> member68, heh
[09:42:21] <adamell> Does anyone know how to start 4.0.3 via the terminal?
[09:42:44] <veeti> my personal opinion is that project managers should have the most control of their project
[09:42:45] <adamell> the emulator-arm, that is
[09:42:55] <veeti> coding guidelines are something that need to be set by each project though
[09:43:02] <veeti> the quick submit thing has spaces and tabs all mixed up already
[09:44:38] <danopia> how many people have submitted?
[09:45:07] <danopia> commited*
[09:45:18] <Sanit> 3 I think
[09:45:25] <danopia> heh
[09:45:36] <veeti> https://github.com/RedditAndroidDev/Reddit-Quick-Submit/contributors
[09:47:34] <Sanit> the spaces and tabs are mostly copy/pasta's by me from the web. I plan on cleaning it up soon. It is rough but working
[09:47:48] <Sanit> what should the standard comment style be?
[09:48:03] <Sanit> new line above what you are commenting on, or same line to the right?
[09:48:23] <veeti> btw
[09:48:30] <veeti> you can autoformat files in eclipse according to the ide settings
[09:48:37] <veeti> select all and ctrl + shift + f or something
[09:48:43] <veeti> if i remember correctly
[09:49:02] <member68> https://github.com/taoufix/Android
[09:49:16] <Sanit> yep, that did it
[09:49:35] <member68> that way we all use the same formatting. just auto format and eclipse will do the rst
[09:49:38] <member68> *rest
[09:49:38] <Hogofwar> member68, pushed to my repo
[09:49:47] <Hogofwar> member68, will now upload when user joins
[09:50:18] <adamell> is kentoe here?
[09:50:37] <member68> great. that should be it for now. it logs everything and pushes it from time to time. good work :)
[09:50:56] <Hogofwar> member68, gotta wait for red_sky to come back so he can run the updated version
[09:51:27] <Hogofwar> might ask him to make an auto-compiler
[09:51:33] <Hogofwar> so it's always up to date :D
[09:51:40] <garychencool> I agree, the dev manage shouldn't have any kind of real communication problem
[09:51:52] <adamell> member68: The project I'm going to ask you to merge with the master is drastically different. Integrating Maven with Android is hell and nothing will ever be the same until the sun explodes and frees me from this hell
[09:52:27] <member68> what do we need maven for=
[09:52:32] <veeti> i started using maven with my app a while back
[09:52:33] <veeti> what's wrong?
[09:52:39] <veeti> it was pretty easy
[09:52:40] <garychencool> It would be better if the projects were localized more, as in the people who are working on it are remotely nearby, like in the same city, county or something like that
[09:52:45] <adamell> Google Tasks API
[09:52:53] <garychencool> later
[09:52:57] ### garychencool has quit the server. (Quit: them classes)
[09:53:33] <adamell> Tasks API = dependencies = maven
[09:53:36] <anyonethinkingab> can i edit my redmine name?
[09:54:06] <member68> i don't know. if it doesn't work, tell me. i can do it
[09:54:31] <member68> adamell: why can't things just be simple for once ;)
[09:54:41] <adamell> NEVER

[09:57:42] <veeti> fixed the package names
[09:57:44] <zubsani> boom
[09:57:49] <zubsani> that was fast!
[09:58:25] <zubsani> thanks

[09:58:50] <anyonethinkingab> anyonethinkingabout
[09:58:55] <member68> ok
[09:59:13] <member68> done
[09:59:20] <anyonethinkingab> top
[10:00:15] <anyonethinkingab> thanks
[10:00:50] <adamell> what SDK version is 7 again?
[10:01:03] <veeti> 2.1
[10:01:08] <adamell> Thanks
[10:02:30] <anyonethinkingab> member68:  can you say logs! please?
[10:02:31] <Hogofwar> Okay
[10:02:36] <Hogofwar> !logs
[10:02:41] <anyonethinkingab> thanks
[10:02:47] <Hogofwar> anyonethinkingab, you coulda said it...
[10:02:56] <anyonethinkingab> oh
[10:02:58] <Hogofwar> Only !upload is op only
[10:03:03] <anyonethinkingab> oh ok :D
[10:03:36] <wjoe> ok... I -think- gerrit is working now
[10:04:00] <Hogofwar> doesn't egit integrate with gerrir
[10:04:03] <Hogofwar> *gerrit
[10:06:25] <anyonethinkingab> oh there he is lol
[10:06:40] <veeti> wjoe: works for me
[10:07:27] <wjoe> wha. I didn't say the URL yet
[10:07:57] <Sanit> why was the target in RQS changed to 15? shouldn't it be 8?[C
[10:08:04] <veeti> i know all your secrets
[10:08:05] <Sanit> threw a load of errors when I pulled
[10:08:14] <wjoe> scary
[10:08:22] <veeti> Sanit: it was already 15 in the manifest but not project.properties so i thought that was the intention
[10:08:27] <veeti> builds fine for me
[10:08:32] <veeti> do you have 15 installed?
[10:08:34] <wjoe> well it's lc8n.com:8080 at the moment, but I need to get it working behind apache so I can give it a nicer URL
[10:09:10] <Sanit> nope, only up to 14.. but 8 should be the highest, right?
[10:09:18] <veeti> why?
[10:09:36] <Sanit> 2.1
[10:09:42] <Sanit> instead of 4.0.3
[10:09:47] <veeti> oh
[10:09:50] <veeti> the minimum is still set to 8
[10:09:58] <Sanit> what is the target?
[10:10:03] <veeti> target is 15
[10:10:07] <Sanit> as in, what does it do?
[10:10:19] <veeti> it defines the android sdk version it's built against
[10:10:29] <adamell> veeti: member68: would you like the min SDK for Google Tasker to be 8 as well?
[10:10:43] <Sanit> right
[10:10:50] <Sanit> i'll install 15 and put it back
[10:10:55] <adamell> With all the reworking I bumped it down to 7
[10:11:16] <veeti> i think that its the project manager's decision
[10:11:31] <adamell> fair enough
[10:11:35] <veeti> i'd advise all projects to target and design for ics since backwards compatibility is easy with actionbarsherlock
[10:12:29] <member68> adamell: yes, target is 15, min is 8
[10:13:24] <Hogofwar> is the action bar the thing that comes up when you press the minu button?
[10:13:29] <Hogofwar> menu
[10:13:41] <veeti> no, the action bar is a replacement for the menu
[10:13:48] <veeti> in android 3.0 and above
[10:13:59] <Hogofwar> I hate it
[10:14:09] <Hogofwar> wait no
[10:14:11] <Hogofwar> not that
[10:14:13] <member68> wjoe: i just signed up. works so far
[10:14:29] <Hogofwar> The list of options that pops up when i press menu I hate
[10:14:40] <Hogofwar> I much preffered the old style of icons along the bottom of the screen
[10:14:44] <Hogofwar> much easier to touch
[10:14:56] <wjoe> ok. let me know if there's any problems, still setting some things up
[10:15:20] ### markerz has quit the server. (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[10:15:59] <Hogofwar> why does markerz keep quitting/joining
[10:16:48] <veeti> probably connection problems
[10:17:11] <Hogofwar> woudn't like to have that connection
[10:18:58] <member68> maybe he's using is school's wifi on his phone. i have the same problem at my university
[10:21:56] <member68> wjoe: can i help somehow? like start setting up projects?
[10:23:13] <deliwien> anyonethinkingab, just responded to your pm on reddit
[10:23:17] <wjoe> sure. just working on server side stuff at the moment. feel free to add/change anything on the site

[11:03:46] <wjoe> sorry, working on it, I think something's not set up right though :/ I can't even add anything myself at the moment
[11:05:23] <member68> i read something about the first user that registers is given admin rights
[11:05:52] ### aesptux has quit the server. (Quit: Leaving)
[11:06:03] <member68> mmh...my account id is "2". means you would be "1" which should be admin
[11:06:51] <wjoe> yeah. should be. well, I have an 'Administration' tab, which has 'Groups' and 'Projects' links, but I can't do anything within that
[11:07:04] <member68> same for me
[11:07:28] <member68> check the database, maybe someone was faster and registered as "0"
[11:07:58] <veeti> i think that admin thing is visible to anyone
[11:08:06] <veeti> try signing in at https://android-review.googlesource.com/ and it'll show up
[11:09:42] ### RAWR has quit the server. (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
[11:09:57] <wjoe> just me, you, and veeti registered (in that order). as far as I can tell from the database though, no one is assigned to any groups. I tried adding myself to the administrator group manually, it didn't do anything
[11:10:37] <wjoe> I dunno, something's probably not set up right. I got past the error setting it up by manually adding a file, but it should have made it itself. think there's some deeper problem
[11:12:18] <veeti> maybe you need to restart gerrit for the change to take effect
[11:13:04] <member68> the only requirement is jdk 1.6
[11:13:30] <member68> and a mysql db
[11:13:48] <member68> not really what I'd call complicated requirements

[11:44:01] <member68> red_sky's a guy
[11:44:26] <member68> !logs
[11:45:08] <Hogofwar> red_sky, did a small update to logbot, considering I am updating it like this and I have to ask you each time, is it possible for you to set up an auto-compiler from git, or failing that... and more likely just download the compiled jar from git and run it if it is new
[11:46:17] <red_sky> Yeah, I can definitely set something like that up
[11:46:22] <red_sky> I'll have to remember to do it in a bit
[11:46:30] <red_sky> I'm doing some serious code-crunching at work atm
[11:46:46] <Hogofwar> Okay, also member68 requested an upload at user join, so I implemented that
[11:46:59] <Hogofwar> Though in config you can turn it off if needed
[11:47:10] <red_sky> ok
[11:47:19] <Hogofwar> have fun with numbers!

[12:33:39] <danopia> stupid tiredness
[12:34:03] <jaimeh_> I have done the setting alarm part and still woke up an hour after a test. Sleep 8 hours before a test is my lesson
[12:34:15] <jaimeh_> That was a quite a while ago
[12:34:32] <member68> when is the next time you get a chance to take that test?
[12:34:48] <danopia> member68, i'm pretty sure it doesn't work like that
[12:34:56] <danopia> so i think i just failed this class...
[12:35:12] <jaimeh_> danopia: Will have to get A's on all other parts of the class to pull out a C
[12:35:14] <tmoskowite> My buddy slept through his final
[12:35:22] <tmoskowite> he walked in and everyone was turning in their exams
[12:35:37] <tmoskowite> he has never done anything like that before....i think he cried
[12:35:55] <tmoskowite> He is one of those A+++ students
[12:36:21] <jaimeh_> Well danopia, you are not alone. Remember to get your sleep next time.
[12:36:26] <danopia> heh
[12:36:38] <danopia> my mistake was definately being less than 5 feet from the bed
[12:37:16] <TheNumb> Bed y u so comfy? :<
[12:39:13] <jaimeh_> Looks like we may see a rage comic from danopia soon...
[12:39:29] <danopia> sorry, i don't make them
[12:39:49] <joholz> y u no make comics

[12:42:34] ### Guest39575 has quit the server. (Client Quit)
[12:42:54] <danopia> whelp, i guess i might as well go to bed for real now...
[12:43:41] <jaimeh_> Do we have gerrit setup?
[12:43:47] <joholz> for the repo on redmine, that repo will sync to the git one?
[12:44:07] <joholz> or a push needs to be made to both git/redmine?
[12:44:29] <member68> redmine syncs from github automatically
[12:44:32] <joholz> danopia: laters
[12:44:42] <jaimeh_> danopia: sleep of butterflys and tests
[12:44:58] ### lacop has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[12:45:26] <joholz> @member68, so I just have to focus on pushing to git?
[12:45:27] <lacop> hey
[12:45:33] <joholz> lcaop wassap
[12:45:34] <lacop> what's new today?
[12:45:45] ### margosmark has quit the server. (Remote host closed the connection)
[12:45:48] <lacop> funny how everyone mispells it the same way :)
[12:45:55] <jaimeh_> Everyone quit, project is over lacop.
[12:46:14] <joholz> im trying to get my git stuff together
[12:46:17] <lacop> philosoraptor - then why is everyone still here
[12:46:47] ### ballpointcarrot has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[12:46:59] <member68> joholz: everybody will push to gerrit and pull from github
[12:47:27] <member68> gerrit is being configured as we speak
[12:48:47] <joholz> alright, another thing I need to get familiar with
[12:50:09] <member68> it's quite easy actually. used it before while working on cyanogenmod
[12:50:26] <lacop> you just commit to a different place, and wait for approval
[12:50:45] <jaimeh_> Are going to use the RC or current stable?
[12:50:52] <jaimeh_> I am talking about gerrit.
[12:51:00] <Hogofwar> I swear github has something like that
[12:51:10] <lacop> btw, do we have some guidelines for branching? should everyone make a branch for their thing, then push it to gerrit when it's done
[12:51:20] <lacop> and then it'll be merged to master
[12:51:34] <jaimeh_> EVERYONE FORKS
[12:52:52] <jaimeh_> Hogofwar: Yes they do have something like that. You submit a patch and it gets added as an issue to be reviewed.
[12:54:02] <jaimeh_> The person running master does a merge once the patch is accepted.
[12:56:12] <RAWR> Anyone know of a good pdf reader (on linux) that has support for annotations?
[12:56:55] <danopia> what are annotatoins?
[12:57:14] <RAWR> Like comments, add shapes, underline and all that
[12:57:23] <TheNumb> RAWR: adobe reader does that.
[12:57:25] <danopia> don't think i've ever seen that before....
[12:57:40] <TheNumb> danopia: you can underline some text etc.
[12:57:40] <jaimeh_> danopia: I believe evince does it.
[12:58:45] <RAWR> Alright thanks, gonna reboot to linux and try them out. Brb.
[12:59:14] <TheNumb> danopia: why?
[12:59:22] ### RAWR has quit the server. (Quit: Leaving)
[13:00:44] <danopia> nvm
[13:01:07] <danopia> i shuold stop complaining here :P
[13:03:13] <member68> finally: i can now write emails via admin@redditandroiddevelopers.com
[13:03:35] <danopia> gmail?
[13:04:00] <member68> no, it's part of my hosting deal
[13:04:06] <member68> comes with the domain
[13:05:55] <jaimeh_> member68: get subdomains working yet to use for redmine?
[13:07:04] <member68> no, i guess we have to do without them for now. I'm in the process of upgrading to a v-server and I'll probably host all systems on one server in the future
[13:07:24] <jaimeh_> Same host?
[13:07:41] <member68> either that or we wait 60 days before I can transfer my domain to another registrar
[13:07:51] <member68> v-server will be quicker though
[13:08:06] <TheNumb> 60 days?
[13:08:06] <TheNumb> wat?
[13:08:07] <TheNumb> oO
[13:08:10] <Hogofwar> (what's a v-server)
[13:08:16] <TheNumb> Hogofwar: virtual server
[13:08:21] <Hogofwar> A vps?
[13:08:30] <TheNumb> I don't think so.
[13:08:53] <jaimeh_> I believe he has a dedicated server.
[13:10:10] <member68> vps should be the same as a vserver
[13:11:12] ### markerz| has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[13:12:11] <lacop> vserver can be confused with the webserver meaning, where you run multiple sites from the same IP
[13:12:29] <member68> my server will have a ip on its own
[13:13:06] <lacop> no I mean like different things for subdomains or even different domains ... nevermind
[13:13:43] <member68> my goal is to have everything on one server one day, with subdomains pointing to the individual systems we use. possibly even have a synchronized user database between systems
[13:13:44] <jaimeh_> lacop: virtual host?
[13:14:04] <member68> for know we can use wjoe's setup which should be fine
[13:14:05] <lacop> yes, but some people call it virtual server
[13:14:21] <lacop> member68, how's the gerrit going?
[13:14:52] <wjoe> slowly
[13:14:59] <wjoe> it exists but it's not really working
[13:15:10] <jaimeh_> What is not working?
[13:16:18] <wjoe> the first account registered should have had admin permissions, but it doesn't. I can't change any settings/projects/etc
[13:16:44] <wjoe> also can't use the ssh interface to set up projects
[13:16:49] <jaimeh_> member68: if you plan on hosting all of it on one vps, it better have a lot of memory. Redmine/ruby, gerrit/java
[13:17:12] <member68> define a lot
[13:17:53] <jaimeh_> At least 1 gigs for the kind of hits we may be getting for now.
[13:18:12] <member68> got 1 gig at the moment, can upgrade to 2 anytime
[13:18:45] <jaimeh_> Just don't go off spending money like crazy.
[13:19:02] <wjoe> well, I don't mind hosting it for however long. my server isn't doing much, and I've spent most of this week setting it up :p
[13:19:03] <jaimeh_> We should probably figure this out better as we grow.
[13:19:15] <member68> the v-server costs 2 dollars less per month than my current hosting package
[13:19:30] <jaimeh_> $40/month?
[13:20:01] <member68> close: 10$/month
[13:20:32] <wjoe> were you not able to change the DNS stuff?
[13:20:32] <jaimeh_> who is hosting 2 gigs for $10?
[13:21:04] <Hogofwar> member68, keeping the domains on the same place?
[13:21:34] <member68> 1 core, 1 gig ram, 25 gig hdd, unlimited traffic, plesk 10 for 10 bucks, same but with 2 gig: $17/month
[13:21:41] <member68> Hogofwar, yes
[13:21:53] <member68> at least for the next 60 days
[13:22:08] <Hogofwar> do you even need 1 gig of ram for systems like what I guess youa re gonna use
[13:22:19] ### smirk has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[13:22:57] <smirk> goodmorning eryone
[13:23:07] <TheNumb> smirk: good evening (:
[13:23:17] <member68> redmine needs ruby, gerrit needs java, besides that: php, a mysql database
[13:23:18] <Raionic-> Good afternoon
[13:23:22] <Raionic-> :)
[13:23:25] <TheNumb> Raionic-: ;D
[13:23:30] <TheNumb> member68: + java for jenkins :P
[13:23:44] <jaimeh_> Hogofwar: not for the most part, but ruby tends to use a good amount of memory with redmine. Not a big deal but he is using multiple languages for other things.
[13:23:47] <smirk> night in your location?
[13:24:06] <smirk> numb
[13:24:24] <jaimeh_> jenkins, what a sexy man that is right?
[13:24:28] <member68> it should be able to run all the things we need for now
[13:24:42] <member68> I'm ordering tomorrow, btw
[13:24:53] <wjoe> well, is there much point in me spending time setting things up on my server then?
[13:24:57] <TheNumb> smirk: not yet ;-)
[13:25:05] ### vcarl has quit the server. (Ping timeout: 246 seconds)
[13:25:28] <member68> actually yes. i hope to copy everything over to my system without chaning much of the settings
[13:25:33] <member68> what os do you have?
[13:25:41] <wjoe> gentoo linux on my server
[13:25:49] <smirk> what time is itthere thenumb?
[13:26:00] <wjoe> surely it would be easier to sort out the DNS stuff than to set up a new server?
[13:26:15] <TheNumb> smirk: 18:28
[13:26:23] <jaimeh_> wjoe: I would say so.
[13:26:24] <TheNumb> smirk: at my location?
[13:26:54] <smirk> where u at?
[13:26:58] <member68> i called them and explained my situation. they told me it didn't make any sense and that it was impossible
[13:27:22] <jaimeh_> just point the nameservers elsewhere?
[13:27:22] <TheNumb> smirk: somewhere in central europe.
[13:27:26] <wjoe> impossible to change the nameservers? I think they just want your money :p
[13:27:44] <member68> the v-server costs less than my current hosting package
[13:28:11] <jaimeh_> Where are you getting hosting? Apparently, I pay too much at linode.
[13:28:26] <member68> it's a small german hoster called 1blu
[13:28:46] <smirk> is there ghetto areas there like gangs and spraypaint on walls?
[13:29:15] <member68> jaimeh: terrible support though. used to have a friend working there who toke care of things. he quit some time ago though
[13:29:25] ### markerz_ has joined ##reddit-android-developers
[13:30:06] <jaimeh_> smirk: try to stay on topic please.
[13:30:18] ### markerz has quit the server. (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[13:30:26] <smirk> ok
[13:30:34] <wjoe> I just think it's a bit silly to set everything up again on another server when I've spent the better part of a week doing it. but I guess I'm biased :p
[13:30:56] <smirk> just trying to make frinds too
[13:31:13] <smirk> friends
[13:31:44] <member68> it'll take at least 1-2 weeks till i get the server. but i'd rather not wait that long before starting development
[13:31:54] <joholz> member68, do we have the gerrit link for repo somewhere?
[13:32:12] <joholz> or just working on it?
[13:32:18] <wjoe> still working on it
[13:32:20] <member68> gerrit doesn't work yet
[13:32:25] <joholz> ok
[13:32:38] <wjoe> I guess you get the fun of doing all this setup again in a week or two then ;)
[13:32:41] <jaimeh_> At this point we probably should just use patch pushes on github.
[13:34:06] <member68> what do you think, wjoe? it's a lot of work you do (i haven't forgotten that) so you should have a saying in this as well
[13:34:32] <smirk> well im gonna watch tv then while my computer is being hit by that fuck ass in his car who left his lights off
[13:35:09] <jaimeh_> It will be okay, wjoe
[13:36:10] <wjoe> it does make sense to have this centralised, but the setup has been quite awkward, and I'm not certain everything will transfer across easily
[13:36:53] <wjoe> not sure how much control you get with a virtual server, but it's probably adequate. and I think they're talking nonsense about not being able to change the nameservers :p
[13:37:13] <TheNumb> wjoe: apparently that vserver is just a vps.
[13:38:08] <jaimeh_> It is not too hard to host all of it on one server
[13:38:18] <jaimeh_> just use apache vhosts
[13:38:27] <TheNumb> apache ;o
[13:39:25] <jaimeh_> I mean apache through passenger for redmine, php is default, and java is through a reverse proxy
[13:39:44] <member68> I'd say we continue to use wjoe's server. when the time comes we can decide again if we want to centralise the systems
[13:40:03] <member68> i'm getting the server no matter what as it's cheaper than my current hosting package
[13:40:08] <wjoe> makes sense
[13:41:07] <member68> is that ok with you, wjoe?
[13:42:01] <jaimeh_> wjoe does have a dedicated server, but with an atom processor. It seems it has been running decently. Although redmine seems to lag at times.
[13:42:23] ### smirk has quit the server. (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[13:42:42] <TheNumb> Redmine tends to be cpu & memory intensive
[13:42:48] <member68> i think he also runs some other stuff on there like minecraft
[13:42:55] <member68> or was that someone else?
[13:42:59] <wjoe> sure. don't want to make a fuss about it, just not got much free time in the next few days, so I don't want to spend loads of time on things if it's not going to be useful
[13:43:04] <wjoe> oh, I shut down the minecraft server, but yeah
[13:43:24] <wjoe> there's not much running on there, IRC and some other things. but yeah, the CPU is a bit weak

[13:57:17] <anyonethinkingab> i don't know, if there are good pm's?
[13:58:10] <Hogofwar> Anyone here getting a raspberry pi?
[13:58:25] <jaimeh_> I plan to, but not for a couple months
[13:58:31] <jaimeh_> Is it out yet?
[13:58:37] <member68> they are postpone. i want everybody to know the systems before working on an app that is as important to many of us as a reddit client
[13:58:45] <Hogofwar> jaimeh_, it had one manufacturing run but sold out within minutes
[13:59:09] <Hogofwar> They are yet to get another shipment out and AFAIK you have to register your interest to get a chance to get one
[13:59:16] <wjoe> I ordered one on the day it was announced, but still going to be waiting at least a month
[13:59:19] <jaimeh_> That is okay with me then. Ill get it when they have more.
[13:59:35] <anyonethinkingab> member68:  the quick submit app stays?
[13:59:38] <wjoe> delivery estimate was supposedly 14th april, but I wouldn't count on it
[13:59:53] <Hogofwar> anyonethinkingab, that's easy though
[13:59:56] <anyonethinkingab> ok ok
[14:00:06] <anyonethinkingab> i got a couple reaction
[14:00:07] <anyonethinkingab> s
[14:00:35] <member68> yes, it's much easier and can be integrated into a reddit client later if we want to

[14:01:51] ### markerz| has quit the server. (Ping timeout: 246 seconds)
[14:02:33] <aschneid> I'm assuming there will be an announcement when we start on the more complicated apps?
[14:02:57] <anyonethinkingab> deliwien is in for tamagotchi, but needs an experienced pm by his side
[14:04:06] <member68> a tamagotchi app includes creating a lot of graphics which is better suited for experienced devs
[14:05:38] <aschneid> So, do we have a time estimate, or will there be an announcement, for when you are looking for devs for some of the more complicated apps?
[14:06:19] <member68> there will be an announcement. i have no idea how much we need for the current projects
[14:06:55] <tmoskowite> aschneid
[14:07:37] <tmoskowite> aschneid: what is your background?
[14:08:01] <aschneid> I'm a professional Java/JEE developer.
[14:08:18] <aschneid> And have been working on my own Android app for about a year now.
[14:08:20] <aschneid> In my spare time
[14:08:28] <member68> do you have experience with writing games?
[14:09:12] <jaimeh_> Do we need him to have experience. As of this point, much of this is a learning experience for many people
[14:09:13] <aschneid> I'm actually not too interested in the Tamagotchi game
[14:09:24] <tmoskowite> aschneid: how about a Google Task App?
[14:09:36] <aschneid> I'm more interested when you start on the full Reddit app
[14:09:44] <red_sky> could someone explain the Google Task App to me?
[14:09:46] <tmoskowite> then start it
[14:09:57] <aschneid> tmoskowite: it's been postponed.
[14:10:05] <tmoskowite> ok
[14:10:19] <aschneid> Which is why I'm asking about when we think that will be started
[14:10:30] <member68> alright. I'll keep your name on my list and will drop you a message
[14:10:35] <member68> is that ok for you?
[14:10:40] <jaimeh_> red_sky: gmail has tasks. It should sync to that.
[14:10:43] <red_sky> aschneid, perhaps you could join the IRC Client team, if you want to do something harder
[14:11:00] <red_sky> member68, I would also like to be put on that list.  After all, I was the one who suggested the Reddit App
[14:11:10] <red_sky> ah, okay, thanks jaimeh_
[14:11:11] <aschneid> red_sky: I considered it.  I'm just not that invested in IRC at this point.
[14:11:22] <aschneid> member68: yeah, that's fine.
[14:12:03] <member68> i put your names on my whiteboard
[14:12:23] <jaimeh_> Ooh on member68's whiteboard. Exciting :P
[14:12:26] <red_sky> thanks
[14:12:34] <red_sky> I want to make a whiteboard / clearboard at some point
[14:12:35] <member68> that way i see it everyday and don't forget it
[14:12:36] <aschneid> OK. I'll keep an eye here periodically and keep up to date on the quick submit since we think that will be included
[14:12:50] <red_sky> I'll brb
[14:12:54] <red_sky> have to go test some code
[14:13:01] <tmoskowite> red_sky: The google task app will allow you to sync google tasks to a super easy to use task list

[14:55:39] <adamell> done
[14:56:06] <jaimeh> member68: are you going to be PM as well?
[14:56:14] <member68> looks like all permissions are working as intended:)
[14:56:20] <member68> i don't know yet
[14:56:48] <member68> i'll probably help in every project, however won't be a "full" PM

[14:58:25] <anjoyed_o0O> :)
[14:58:30] <jaimeh> Can I trade it on TF2?
[14:58:34] <jaimeh> :P
[14:58:41] <itsKitsos> my disconnects are when I close my laptop to go to my next class :p
[14:58:48] <anjoyed_o0O> only if you get 2 back
[14:59:35] <jaimeh> adamell: Do we have more developers that want to join us, or is this the extent of those that want to be involved?

[15:08:32] <garychencool> sup
[15:12:26] <jaimeh> garychencool: que pasa?
[15:13:24] <member68> I don't want to sit around idle anymore. Why don't we all head to readmine and start adding issues to the tracker? Functionaltiy you want to see, design ideas, etc... From there we can create a basic code construct that people can work on later when we have gerrit running.
[15:14:11] <member68> I'll merge duplicated issues. You can also comment on every idea posted.

[15:14:21] <member68> http://dev.redditandroiddevelopers.com
[15:14:25] <red_sky> member68 is there a way to comment on things on redmine?
[15:14:32] <member68> of course.
[15:14:33] <red_sky> I haven't been able to figure that out
[15:14:46] <member68> very issue can be commented on by using the "update" button
[15:14:50] <red_sky> I don't see any obvious "add comment" while on issues list
[15:14:54] <member68> it's a bit misleading
[15:14:58] <red_sky> okay, see, I didn't click that because it's misleading
[15:15:31] <anjoyed_o0O> install mylyn and it will give you a 'add comment' button for each ticket
[15:16:41] <member68> we have mylyn connector installed. there's a manual in the wiki
